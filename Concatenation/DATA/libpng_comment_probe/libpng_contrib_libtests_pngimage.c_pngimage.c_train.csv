"libpng/contrib/libtests/pngimage.c/pngimage.c","If a transform is valid on both read and write this implies that if the
 * transform is applied to read it must also be applied on write to produce
 * meaningful data.  This is because these transforms when performed on read
 * produce data with a memory format that does not correspond to a PNG format.
 *
 * Most of these transforms are invertible; after applying the transform on
 * write the result is the original PNG data that would have would have been
 * read if no transform were applied.
 *
 * The exception is _SHIFT, which destroys the low order bits marked as not
 * significant in a PNG with the sBIT chunk.
 *
 * The following table lists, for each transform, the conditions under which it
 * is expected to do anything.  Conditions are defined as follows:
 *
 * 1) Color mask bits required - simply a mask to AND with color_type; one of
 *    these must be present for the transform to fire, except that 0 means
 *    'always'.
 * 2) Color mask bits which must be absent - another mask - none of these must
 *    be present.
 * 3) Bit depths - a mask of component bit depths for the transform to fire.
 * 4) 'read' - the transform works in png_read_png.
 * 5) 'write' - the transform works in png_write_png.
 * 6) PNG_INFO_chunk; a mask of the chunks that must be present for the
 *    transform to fire.  All must be present - the requirement is that
 *    png_get_valid() & mask == mask, so if mask is 0 there is no requirement.

 * used together it is possible to cause a transform that wouldn't fire on the
