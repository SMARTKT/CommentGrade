"Purpose
 *
 * 1. Accept a TCP connection on a custom port (IPv4 or IPv6), or connect
 *    to a given (localhost) port.
 *
 * 2. Get commands on STDIN. Pass data on to the TCP stream.
 *    Get data from TCP stream and pass on to STDOUT.
 *
 * This program is made to perform all the socket/stream/connection stuff for
 * the test suite's (perl) FTP server. Previously the perl code did all of
 * this by its own, but I decided to let this program do the socket layer
 * because of several things:
 *
 * o We want the perl code to work with rather old perl installations, thus
 *   we cannot use recent perl modules or features.
 *
 * o We want IPv6 support for systems that provide it, and doing optional IPv6
 *   support in perl seems if not impossible so at least awkward.
 *
 * o We want FTP-SSL support, which means that a connection that starts with
 *   plain sockets needs to be able to ""go SSL"" in the midst. This would also
 *   require some nasty perl stuff I'd rather avoid.

"* Signal handling notes for sockfilt
 * ----------------------------------
 *
 * This program is a single-threaded process.
 *
 * This program is intended to be highly portable and as such it must be kept
 * as simple as possible, due to this the only signal handling mechanisms used
 * will be those of ANSI C, and used only in the most basic form which is good
 * enough for the purpose of this program.
 *
 * For the above reason and the specific needs of this program signals SIGHUP,
 * SIGPIPE and SIGALRM will be simply ignored on systems where this can be
 * done.  If possible, signals SIGINT and SIGTERM will be handled by this
 * program as an indication to cleanup and finish execution as soon as
 * possible.  This will be achieved with a single signal handler
 * 'exit_signal_handler' for both signals.
 *
 * The 'exit_signal_handler' upon the first SIGINT or SIGTERM received signal
 * will just set to one the global var 'got_exit_signal' storing in global var
 * 'exit_signal' the signal that triggered this change.
 *
 * Nothing fancy that could introduce problems is used, the program at certain
 * points in its normal flow checks if var 'got_exit_signal' is set and in
 * case this is true it just makes its way out of loops and functions in
 * structured and well behaved manner to achieve proper program cleanup and
 * termination.
 *
 * Even with the above mechanism implemented it is worthwile to note that
 * other signals might still be received, or that there might be systems on
 * which it is not possible to trap and ignore some of the above signals.
 * This implies that for increased portability and reliability the program
 * must be coded as if no signal was being ignored or handled at all.  Enjoy
 * it!"	curl/tests/server/sockfilt.c/sockfilt.c

 * FormAdd()
 *
 * Stores a formpost parameter and builds the appropriate linked list.
 *
 * Has two principal functionalities: using files and byte arrays as
 * post parts. Byte arrays are either copied or just the pointer is stored
 * (as the user requests) while for files only the filename and not the
 * content is stored.
 *
 * While you may have only one byte array for each name, multiple filenames
 * are allowed (and because of this feature CURLFORM_END is needed after
 * using CURLFORM_FILE).
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Simple name/value pair with copied contents:
 * curl_formadd (&post, &last, CURLFORM_COPYNAME, ""name"",
 * CURLFORM_COPYCONTENTS, ""value"", CURLFORM_END);
 *
 * name/value pair where only the content pointer is remembered:
 * curl_formadd (&post, &last, CURLFORM_COPYNAME, ""name"",
 * CURLFORM_PTRCONTENTS, ptr, CURLFORM_CONTENTSLENGTH, 10, CURLFORM_END);
 * (if CURLFORM_CONTENTSLENGTH is missing strlen () is used)
 *
 * storing a filename (CONTENTTYPE is optional!):
 * curl_formadd (&post, &last, CURLFORM_COPYNAME, ""name"",
 * CURLFORM_FILE, ""filename1"", CURLFORM_CONTENTTYPE, ""plain/text"",
 * CURLFORM_END);
 *
 * storing multiple filenames:
 * curl_formadd (&post, &last, CURLFORM_COPYNAME, ""name"",

"Purpose
 *
 * 1. Accept a TCP connection on a custom port (IPv4 or IPv6), or connect
 *    to a given (localhost) port.
 *
 * 2. Get commands on STDIN. Pass data on to the TCP stream.
 *    Get data from TCP stream and pass on to STDOUT.
 *
 * This program is made to perform all the socket/stream/connection stuff for
 * the test suite's (perl) FTP server. Previously the perl code did all of
 * this by its own, but I decided to let this program do the socket layer
 * because of several things:
 *
 * o We want the perl code to work with rather old perl installations, thus
 *   we cannot use recent perl modules or features.
 *
 * o We want IPv6 support for systems that provide it, and doing optional IPv6
 *   support in perl seems if not impossible so at least awkward.
 *
 * o We want FTP-SSL support, which means that a connection that starts with
 *   plain sockets needs to be able to ""go SSL"" in the midst. This would also
 *   require some nasty perl stuff I'd rather avoid.

"* Signal handling notes for sockfilt
 * ----------------------------------
 *
 * This program is a single-threaded process.
 *
 * This program is intended to be highly portable and as such it must be kept
 * as simple as possible, due to this the only signal handling mechanisms used
 * will be those of ANSI C, and used only in the most basic form which is good
 * enough for the purpose of this program.
 *
 * For the above reason and the specific needs of this program signals SIGHUP,
 * SIGPIPE and SIGALRM will be simply ignored on systems where this can be
 * done.  If possible, signals SIGINT and SIGTERM will be handled by this
 * program as an indication to cleanup and finish execution as soon as
 * possible.  This will be achieved with a single signal handler
 * 'exit_signal_handler' for both signals.
 *
 * The 'exit_signal_handler' upon the first SIGINT or SIGTERM received signal
 * will just set to one the global var 'got_exit_signal' storing in global var
 * 'exit_signal' the signal that triggered this change.
 *
 * Nothing fancy that could introduce problems is used, the program at certain
 * points in its normal flow checks if var 'got_exit_signal' is set and in
 * case this is true it just makes its way out of loops and functions in
 * structured and well behaved manner to achieve proper program cleanup and
 * termination.
 *
 * Even with the above mechanism implemented it is worthwile to note that
 * other signals might still be received, or that there might be systems on
 * which it is not possible to trap and ignore some of the above signals.
 * This implies that for increased portability and reliability the program
 * must be coded as if no signal was being ignored or handled at all.  Enjoy
 * it!"	curl/tests/server/sockfilt.c/sockfilt.c

jc: I have checked, and both versions does give the same result, i.e., clipping
to the window boundaries. The reason is that the above plP_clip_poly() does
the clipping. To check this, is enough to diminish the x/y/z min/max arguments in

int circulation()

Returns the circulation direction for a given polyline: positive is
counterclockwise, negative is clockwise (right hand rule).

Used to get the circulation of the fill polygon around the bounding box,
when the fill polygon is larger than the bounding box.  Counts left
(positive) vs right (negative) hand turns using a cross product, instead of
performing all the expensive trig calculations needed to get this 100%
correct.  For the fill cases encountered in plplot, this treatment should
give the correct answer most of the time, by far.  When used with plshades,
the typical return value is 3 or -3, since 3 turns are necessary in order
to complete the fill region.  Only for really oddly shaped fill regions
will it give the wrong answer.

AM:
Changed the computation: use the outer product to compute the surface
area, the sign determines if the polygon is followed clockwise or
counterclockwise. This is more reliable. Floating-point numbers
are used to avoid overflow.

"Fill intersection of two simple polygons that do no self-intersect,
and which have no duplicate vertices or two consecutive edges that
are parallel.  A further requirement is that both polygons have a
positive orientation (see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve_orientation).  That is, as you
traverse the boundary in index order, the inside area of the
polygon is always on the left.  Finally, the first vertex of
polygon 1 (starting with n1 -1) that is not near the border of
polygon 2 must be outside polygon 2.  N.B. it is the calling
routine's responsibility to insure all those requirements are
satisfied.

Two polygons that do not self intersect must have an even number of
edge crossings between them.  (ignoring vertex intersections which
touch, but do not cross).  fill_intersection_polygon eliminates
those intersection crossings by recursion (calling the same routine
twice again with the second polygon split at a boundary defined by
the first intersection point, all polygon 1 vertices between the
intersections, and the second intersection point).  Once the
recursion has eliminated all crossing edges, fill or not using the
appropriate polygon depending on whether the first and second
polygons are identical or whether one of them is entirely inside
the other of them.  If ifextrapolygon is true, the fill step will
consist of another recursive call to the routine with
ifextrapolygon false, and the second polygon set to an additional
polygon defined by the stream (not yet implemented)."	PLplot/src/plfill.c/plfill.c

ones have been completely processed).
x2, *y2, *if2, n2 define the polygon 2 vertices plus a status indicator
for each vertex which is 1 for a previous crossing and 2 for a polygon
1 vertex.
fill_status is 1 when polygons 1 and 2 _must_ include some joint
filled area and is -1 when polygons 1 and 2 _must_ include some
unfilled area.  fill_status of +/- 1 is determined from the
orientations of polygon 1 and 2 from the next higher recursion
level and how those two are combined to form the polygon 2
split at this recursion level.  fill_status = 0 occurs (at
recursion level 0) for polygons 1 and 2 that are independent of
each other."	PLplot/src/plfill.c/plfill.c

Follow polygon 1 (checking intersections with polygon 2 for each

""1"" marks polygon 1 vertices, ""2"" marks polygon 2 vertices, ""X""
marks the intersections, ""---"" stands for part of polygon 1
that has been previously searched for all possible intersections
from index 0, and ""..."" means polygon 1 continues
with more potential intersections above and/or below this diagram
before it finally hooks back to connect with the index 0 vertex.
""2???2"" stands for parts of polygon 2 that must connect with each other
(since the polygon 1 path between the two intersections is
known to be free of intersections.)

Polygon 2 is split at the boundary defined by the two
intersections and all (in this case three) polygon 1 vertices
between the two intersections for the next recursion level.  We
absolutely know for that boundary that no more intersections can
occur (both polygon 1 and polygon 2 are guaranteed not to
self-intersect) so we mark the status of those vertices with that
information so those polygon 2 split vertices will not be used to
search for further intersections at deeper recursion levels.
Note, we know nothing about whether the remaining ""2???2"" parts of the
split polygon 2 intersect with polygon 1 or not so those will
continued to be searched at deeper recursion levels. At the same
time, we absolutely know that the part of polygon 1 to the left of
rightmost x down to and including index 0 cannot yield more
intersections with any split of polygon 2 so we adjust the lower
limit of polygon 1 to be used for intersection searches at deeper
recursion levels.  The result should be that at sufficiently deep
recursion depth we always end up with the case that there are no
intersections to be found between polygon 1 and some polygon 2
split, and in that case we move on to the end phase below.

Call syntax for plshade():

void plshade(PLFLT *a, PLINT nx, PLINT ny, char *defined,
PLFLT xmin, PLFLT xmax, PLFLT ymin, PLFLT ymax,
PLFLT shade_min, PLFLT shade_max,
PLINT sh_color, PLFLT sh_width, PLINT min_color, PLFLT min_width,
PLINT max_color, PLFLT max_width, void (*fill)(), PLINT
rectangular, ...)

arguments:

PLFLT &(a[0][0])

Contains array to be plotted. The array must have been declared as
PLFLT a[nx][ny].  See following note on fortran-style arrays.

PLINT nx, ny

Dimension of array ""a"".

char &(defined[0][0])

Contains array of flags, 1 = data is valid, 0 = data is not valid.
This array determines which sections of the data is to be plotted.
This argument can be NULL if all the values are valid.  Must have been
declared as char defined[nx][ny].

PLFLT xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax

Defines the ""grid"" coordinates.  The data a[0][0] has a position of
(xmin,ymin).

void (*mapform)()

Transformation from `grid' coordinates to world coordinates.  This
pointer to a function can be NULL in which case the grid coordinates
are the same as the world coordinates.

PLFLT shade_min, shade_max

Defines the interval to be shaded. If shade_max <= shade_min, plshade
does nothing.

PLINT sh_cmap, PLFLT sh_color, PLFLT sh_width

Defines color map, color map index, and width used by the fill pattern.

PLINT min_color, PLFLT min_width, PLINT max_color, PLFLT max_width

Defines pen color, width used by the boundary of shaded region. The min
values are used for the shade_min boundary, and the max values are used
on the shade_max boundary.  Set color and width to zero for no plotted
boundaries.

void (*fill)()

Routine used to fill the region.  Use plfill.  Future version of plplot
may have other fill routines.

PLINT rectangular

Flag. Set to 1 if rectangles map to rectangles after (*mapform)() else
set to zero. If rectangular is set to 1, plshade tries to save time by
filling large rectangles.  This optimization fails if (*mapform)()
distorts the shape of rectangles.  For example a plot in polor
coordinates has to have rectangular set to zero.

Example mapform's:

Grid to world coordinate transformation.
This example goes from a r-theta to x-y for a polar plot.

void mapform(PLINT n, PLFLT *x, PLFLT *y) {
int i;
double r, theta;
for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
r = x[i];
theta = y[i];
x[i] = r*cos(theta);
y[i] = r*sin(theta);
}
}

Grid was in cm, convert to world coordinates in inches.
Expands in x direction.

void mapform(PLINT n, PLFLT *x, PLFLT *y) {
int i;
for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
x[i] = (1.0 / 2.5) * x[i];
y[i] = (1.0 / 2.5) * y[i];
}

This code is a complete departure from the approach taken in the old version
of this routine. Formerly to code attempted to use the logic for the hidden
line algorithm to draw the hidden surface. This was really hard. This code
below uses a simple back to front (painters) algorithm. All the
triangles are drawn.

There are multitude of ways this code could be optimized. Given the
problems with the old code, I tried to focus on clarity here.

Formats a PLFLT value in one of the following formats.

-	If lf (fixed), then used fixed point notation, i.e. .1, 1, 10, etc,
with unnecessary trailing .'s or 0's removed.

-	If !lf (default), then use exponential notation, i.e. 10^-1, etc.

If !ll (linear), then:

- If scale == 0, use fixed point format with ""prec"" places after the
decimal point.

-	If scale == 1, use scientific notation with one place before the
decimal point and ""prec"" places after.  In this case, the value
must be divided by 10^scale.

The axis argument is included to support PLplot's custom axis labeling.  It
is passed on to the custom labeling function if it exists.  Otherwise, it
is ignored.

plslabelfunc

Formats a PLFLT value in one of the following formats.

label_func - A pointer to a function which will provide a string to use
as the label for the given floating point value.
Pass this as NULL to clear the custom function and reset it to
the default PLplot labeling function.

label_data - Extra data to pass to the label function.

The label_func function arguments are, in order:

axis: PL_X_AXIS, PL_Y_AXIS or PL_Z_AXIS to indicate which axis is being
labeled
value: The value at this position on the axis
string: The resulting label string should be stored here
data: A pointer to whatever extra information the custom plotting function
requires

plgriddata(): grids data from irregularly sampled data.

Real world data is frequently irregularly sampled, but most 3D plots
require regularly gridded data. This function does exactly this
using several methods:
Irregularly sampled data x[npts], y[npts], z[npts] is gridded into
zg[nptsx, nptsy] according to methode 'type' and grid information
xg[nptsx], yg[nptsy].

'type' can be:

GRID_NNIDW:  Nearest Neighbors Inverse Distance Weighted
GRID_NNLI:   Nearest Neighbors Linear Interpolation
GRID_NNAIDW: Nearest Neighbors Around Inverse Distance Weighted

plscmap1l()

! Set color map 1 colors using a piece-wise linear relationship between
! position in the color map (from 0 to 1) and position in HLS or RGB color
! space.  May be called at any time.
!
! The idea here is to specify a number of control points that specify the
! mapping between HLS (or RGB or CMY) and palette 1 value.  Between these
! points, linear interpolation is used.  By mapping position in the color
! map to function value, this gives a smooth variation of color with
! intensity.  Any number of control points may be specified, located at
! arbitrary positions (intensities), although typically 2 - 4 are enough.
! Another way of stating this is that we are traversing a given number of
! lines through HLS (or RGB) space as we move through cmap 1 entries.  The
! control points at the minimum and maximum intensity (0 and 1) must
! always be specified.  By adding more control points you can get more
! variation.  One good technique for plotting functions that vary about
! some expected average is to use an additional 2 control points in the
! center (intensity ~= 0.5) that are the same color as the background
! (typically white for paper output, black for crt), and same hue as the
! boundary control points.  This allows the highs and lows to be very
! easily distinguished.
!
! Each control point must specify the position in cmap 1 as well as three
! coordinates in HLS or RGB space.  The first and last points MUST correspond to
! cmap1 coordinates MIN_PLFLT_CMAP1 and MAX_PLFLT_CMAP1.
!
! Every change in hue from one control point to the next can be linearly
! interpolated in two ways.  The usual (alt_hue_path[i] false) method for the ith interval
! uses the dh = h[i+1] - h[i] interval for interpolation.  The alternate (alt_hue_path true) method for the ith interval uses the dh = (h[i+1] - h[i]) - 360 if (h[i+1] - h[i]) is positive or dh = 360 - (h[i+1] - h[i]) if (h[i+1] - h[i]) is negative interval for the interpolation.  Thus, alt_hue_path true interpolation intervals always include hue = 0.
! Specifying
! alt_hue_path=NULL is equivalent to setting alt_hue_path[]=false for every control point.
!
! Bounds on RGB coordinates:
!	R,G,B		[0, 1]		magnitude

! Bounds on HLS coordinates:

!  These function perform variuos affine transformations.
!
! For background on these affine functions see SVG specification, e.g.,
! http://www.w3.org/TR/SVGTiny12/coords.html#EstablishingANewUserSpace.
! Affine 3x3 matrices with elements A_i,j always have a last row of
! 0, 0, 1 so the elements are conveniently stored in a vector in the order
! A_1_1, A_2_1, A_1_2, A_2_2, A_1_3, A_2_3, with the last row implied.
!
! N.B.  The PLplot affine interpretation of translate, scale, etc., is
! as actions on coordinate systems, rather than actions on objects.  This
! is identical to the SVG specficiation interpretation.  However, the
! SVG specification interprets the affine matrix as follows:
! old_coord_vector = affine_matrix * new_coordinate vector.  In PLplot
! we use the alternative interpretation
! new_coord_vector = affine_matrix * old_coordinate vector.
! The result is all affine matrices below are the inverses of the SVG
! equivalents.
!
! N.B. All PLplot affine functions below return the affine matrix result (in
! vector form) as the first argument).  It is the calling routine's
! responsibility to provide the space for all affine matrix arguments,
! i.e., a PLFLT array with a dimension of 6.

up to the user to make sure pltr_data is something non-NULL if pltr
requires it.
Plottable values in idata must be scaled between COLOR_MIN and COLOR_MAX.
This is an internal function, and should not be used directly.  Its
interface may change.

void plpoly3( n, x, y, z, draw, ifcc )

Draws a polygon in 3 space.  This differs from plline3() in that
this attempts to determine if the polygon is viewable.  If the back
of polygon is facing the viewer, then it isn't drawn.  If this
isn't what you want, then use plline3 instead.

n specifies the number of points.  They are assumed to be in a
plane, and the directionality of the plane is determined from the
first three points.  Additional points do not /have/ to lie on the
plane defined by the first three, but if they do not, then the
determiniation of visibility obviously can't be 100% accurate...
So if you're 3 space polygons are too far from planar, consider
breaking them into smaller polygons.  ""3 points define a plane"" :-).

For ifcc == 1, the directionality of the polygon is determined by assuming
the points are laid out in counter-clockwise order.

For ifcc == 0, the directionality of the polygon is determined by assuming
the points are laid out in clockwise order.

BUGS:  If one of the first two segments is of zero length, or if
they are colinear, the calculation of visibility has a 50/50 chance
of being correct.  Avoid such situations :-).  See x18c for an
example of this problem.  (Search for ""20.1"").

! @file
!  This file contains routines to extract & process command flags.  The
!  command flags recognized by PLplot are stored in the ""ploption_table""
!  structure, along with strings giving the syntax, long help message, and
!  option handler.
!
!  The command line parser -- plparseopts() -- removes all recognized flags
!  (decreasing argc accordingly), so that invalid input may be readily
!  detected.  It can also be used to process user command line flags.  The
!  user can merge an option table of type PLOptionTable into the internal
!  option table info structure using plMergeOpts().  Or, the user can
!  specify that ONLY the external table(s) be parsed by calling
!  plClearOpts() before plMergeOpts().
!
!  The default action taken by plparseopts() is as follows:
!      - Returns with an error if an unrecognized option or badly formed
!        option-value pair are encountered.
!      - Returns immediately (return code 0) when the first non-option
!        command line argument is found.
!      - Returns with the return code of the option handler, if one
!        was called.
!      - Deletes command line arguments from argv list as they are found,
!        and decrements argc accordingly.
!      - Does not show ""invisible"" options in usage or help messages.
!      - Assumes the program name is contained in argv[0].
!
!  These behaviors may be controlled through the ""mode"" argument, which can
!  have the following bits set:
!
!  PL_PARSE_FULL -- Full parsing of command line and all error messages
!  enabled, including program exit when an error occurs.  Anything on the
!  command line that isn't recognized as a valid option or option argument
!  is flagged as an error.
!
!  PL_PARSE_QUIET -- Turns off all output except in the case of
!  errors.
!
!  PL_PARSE_NODELETE -- Turns off deletion of processed arguments.
!
!  PL_PARSE_SHOWALL -- Show invisible options
!
!  PL_PARSE_NOPROGRAM -- Specified if argv[0] is NOT a pointer to the
!  program name.
!
!  PL_PARSE_NODASH -- Set if leading dash is NOT required.
!
!  PL_PARSE_SKIP -- Set to quietly skip over any unrecognized args.
!
!  Note: if you want to have both your option and a PLplot option of the
!  same name processed (e.g. the -v option in plrender), do the following:
!      1. Tag your option with PL_OPT_NODELETE
!      2. Give it an option handler that uses a return code of 1.
!      3. Merge your option table in.
!  By merging your table, your option will be processed before the PLplot
!  one.  The PL_OPT_NODELETE ensures that the option string is not deleted
!  from the argv list, and the return code of 1 ensures that the parser
!  continues looking for it.
!
!  See plrender.c for examples of actual usage.

Support routines for freetype font engine

This file contains a series of support routines for drivers interested
in using freetype rendered fonts instead of plplot plotter fonts.
Freetype supports a gerth of font formats including TrueType, OpenType,
Adobe Type1, Type42 etc... the list seems almost endless. Any bitmap
driver should be able to use any of these freetype fonts from plplot if
these routines are properly initialised.

Freetype support is not intended to be a ""feature"" of the common API,
but is  implemented as a driver-specific optional extra invoked via the
-drvopt command line toggle. It is intended to be used in the context of
""PLESC_HAS_TEXT"" for any bitmap drivers without native font support.
Implementing freetype in this manner minimise changes to the overall
API. Because of this approach, there is not a ""wealth"" of font options
available to the programmer. You can not do anything you can't do for a
normal freetype plotter font like boldface. You can do most of the
things that you can do with a plotter font however, like greek
characters superscripting, and selecting one of the four ""pre-defined""
plplot font types. At present underlining and overlining are not
supported.

To give the user some level of control over the fonts that are used,
environmental variables can be set to over-ride the definitions used by
the five default plplot fonts.

The exact syntax for evoking freetype fonts is dependant on each
driver, but for the GD and GNUSVGA drivers I have followed the syntax of
the PS driver and use the command-line switch of ""-drvopt text"" to
activate the feature, and suggest other programmers do the same for
commonality.

Both anti-aliased and monochrome font rendering is supported by these
routines. How these are evoked depends on the programmer, but with the
GD and GNUSVGA driver families I have used the command-line switch
""-drvopt smooth"" to activate the feature; but, considering you also need
to turn freetype on, it would probably really be more like ""-drvopt
text,smooth"".

"Freetype lets you set the text size absolutely. It also takes into
account the DPI when doing so. So does plplot. Why, then, is it that the
size of the text drawn by plplot is bigger than the text drawn by
freetype when given IDENTICAL parameters ? Perhaps I am missing
something somewhere, but to fix this up we use TEXT_SCALING_FACTOR to
set a scaling factor to try and square things up a bit.

the CPU hit for this ""double processing"" will be minimal.

Things seems to work better with this line than without it;
I guess because there is no vertical kerning or advancement for most

Next we load the char. This also draws the char, transforms it, and
converts it to a bitmap. At present this is a bit wasteful, but
if/when I add cache support, then this data won't go to waste.
Since there is no sense in going to the trouble of doing anti-aliasing
calculations since we aren't REALLY plotting anything, we will render
this as monochrome since it is probably marginally quicker. If/when
cache support is added, naturally this will have to change.

Adjust for the descender - make sure the font is nice and centred
vertically. Freetype assumes we have a base-line, but plplot thinks of
centre-lines, so that's why we have to do this. Since this is one of our
own adjustments, rather than a freetype one, we have to run it through
the transform matrix manually.

For some odd reason, this works best if we triple the
descender's height and then adjust the height later on...
Don't ask me why, 'cause I don't know. But it does seem to work.

I really wish I knew *why* it worked better though...

We run the OFFSET for the super-script and sub-script through the

kerning and advancing from character to character is transformed

feature of plplot, and not freetype, we have to make allowances.

"(RL, on 2005-01-21) The height_factor variable is introduced below.
It is used here and farther below when computing the vertical
adjustment.  The rationale for its introduction is as follow: up to
now, the text produced with Hershey fonts was systematically taller
than the same text produced with TT fonts, and tha by a factor of
around 1.125 (I discovered this empirically).  This corresponds
roughly to the ratio between total height and the ascender of some
TT faces.  Hence the computation below.  Remember that descender is
always a negative quantity.

"Adjust for the justification and character height

Eeeksss... this wasn't a nice bit of code to work out, let me tell you.
I could not work out an entirely satisfactory solution that made
logical sense, so came up with an ""illogical"" one as well.
The logical one works fine for text in the normal ""portrait""
orientation, and does so for reasons you might expect it to work; But
for all other orientations, the text's base line is either a little
high, or a little low. This is because of the way the base-line pos
is calculated from the decender height. The ""dodgie"" way of calculating
the position is to use the character height here, then adjust for the
decender height by a three-fold factor later on. That approach seems to
work a little better for rotated pages, but why it should be so, I
don't understand. You can compile in or out which way you want it by
defining ""DODGIE_DECENDER_HACK"".

note: the logic of the page rotation coming up next is that we pump in
the justification factor and then use freetype to rotate and transform
the values, which we then use to change the plotting location.

"(RL, on 2005-01-24) The code below uses floating point and division
operations instead of integer shift used before. This is slower but
gives accurate placement of text in plots.
"	PLplot/src/plfreetype.c/plfreetype.c
"(RL, on 2005-01-21) The hack below is intended to align single
glyphs being generated via plpoin.  The way to detect this
situation is completely hackish, I must admit, by checking whether the
length of the Unicode array is equal 2 and whether the first
character is actually a font-changing command to font number 4 (for
symbols).  This is ugly because it depends on definitions set
elsewhere, but it works.

The computation of the vertical and horizontal adjustments are
based on the bouding box of the glyph being loaded (since there is
only one glyph in the string in this case, we are okay here).
"	PLplot/src/plfreetype.c/plfreetype.c
"(RL, on 2005-01-21) The vertical adjustment is set below, making
the DODGIE conditional moot.  I use the value of h as return by FT_StrX_YW,
which should correspond to the total height of the text being
drawn.  Freetype aligns text around the baseline, while PLplot
aligns to the center of the ascender portion.  We must then adjust
by half of the ascender and this is why there is a division by
height_factor below.

Adjust for the descender - make sure the font is nice and centred
vertically. Freetype assumes we have a base-line, but plplot thinks of
centre-lines, so that's why we have to do this. Since this is one of our
own adjustments, rather than a freetype one, we have to run it through
the transform matrix manually.

For some odd reason, this works best if we triple the
descender's height and then adjust the height later on...
Don't ask me why, 'cause I don't know. But it does seem to work.

I really wish I knew *why* it worked better though...

Now we have to try and componsate for the fact that the freetype glyphs are left
justified, and plplot's glyphs are centred. To do this, we will just work out the
advancment, halve it, and take it away from the x position. This wont be 100%
accurate because ""spacing"" is factored into the right hand side of the glyph,
but it is as good a way as I can think of.

PLFLT shade_min, PLFLT shade_max,
PLINT sh_color, PLFLT sh_width, PLINT min_color, PLFLT min_width,
PLINT max_color, PLFLT max_width, void (*fill)(), PLINT
rectangular, ...)

arguments:

PLFLT &(a[0][0])

Contains array to be plotted. The array must have been declared as
PLFLT a[nx][ny].  See following note on fortran-style arrays.

PLINT nx, ny

Dimension of array ""a"".

char &(defined[0][0])

Contains array of flags, 1 = data is valid, 0 = data is not valid.
This array determines which sections of the data is to be plotted.
This argument can be NULL if all the values are valid.  Must have been
declared as char defined[nx][ny].

PLFLT xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax

Defines the ""grid"" coordinates.  The data a[0][0] has a position of
(xmin,ymin).

void (*mapform)()

Transformation from `grid' coordinates to world coordinates.  This
pointer to a function can be NULL in which case the grid coordinates
are the same as the world coordinates.

PLFLT shade_min, shade_max

Defines the interval to be shaded. If shade_max <= shade_min, plshade
does nothing.

PLINT sh_cmap, PLFLT sh_color, PLFLT sh_width

Defines color map, color map index, and width used by the fill pattern.

PLINT min_color, PLFLT min_width, PLINT max_color, PLFLT max_width

Defines pen color, width used by the boundary of shaded region. The min
values are used for the shade_min boundary, and the max values are used
on the shade_max boundary.  Set color and width to zero for no plotted
boundaries.

void (*fill)()

Routine used to fill the region.  Use plfill.  Future version of plplot
may have other fill routines.

PLINT rectangular

Flag. Set to 1 if rectangles map to rectangles after (*mapform)() else
set to zero. If rectangular is set to 1, plshade tries to save time by
filling large rectangles.  This optimization fails if (*mapform)()
distorts the shape of rectangles.  For example a plot in polor
coordinates has to have rectangular set to zero.

Example mapform's:

Grid to world coordinate transformation.
This example goes from a r-theta to x-y for a polar plot.

void mapform(PLINT n, PLFLT *x, PLFLT *y) {
int i;
double r, theta;
for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
r = x[i];
theta = y[i];
x[i] = r*cos(theta);
y[i] = r*sin(theta);
}
}

Grid was in cm, convert to world coordinates in inches.
Expands in x direction.

void mapform(PLINT n, PLFLT *x, PLFLT *y) {
int i;
for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
x[i] = (1.0 / 2.5) * x[i];
y[i] = (1.0 / 2.5) * y[i];
}

plslabelfunc

Formats a PLFLT value in one of the following formats.

label_func - A pointer to a function which will provide a string to use
as the label for the given floating point value.
Pass this as NULL to clear the custom function and reset it to
the default PLplot labeling function.

label_data - Extra data to pass to the label function.

The label_func function arguments are, in order:

axis: PL_X_AXIS, PL_Y_AXIS or PL_Z_AXIS to indicate which axis is being
labeled
value: The value at this position on the axis
string: The resulting label string should be stored here
data: A pointer to whatever extra information the custom plotting function
requires

plgriddata(): grids data from irregularly sampled data.

Real world data is frequently irregularly sampled, but most 3D plots
require regularly gridded data. This function does exactly this
using several methods:
Irregularly sampled data x[npts], y[npts], z[npts] is gridded into
zg[nptsx, nptsy] according to methode 'type' and grid information
xg[nptsx], yg[nptsy].

'type' can be:

GRID_CSA:    Bivariate Cubic Spline approximation (1)
GRID_NNIDW:  Nearest Neighbors Inverse Distance Weighted
GRID_NNLI:   Nearest Neighbors Linear Interpolation
GRID_NNAIDW: Nearest Neighbors Around Inverse Distance Weighted
GRID_DTLI:   Delaunay Triangulation Linear Interpolation (2)
GRID_NNI:    Natural Neighbors interpolation (2)

void plpoly3( n, x, y, z, draw, ifcc )

Draws a polygon in 3 space.  This differs from plline3() in that
this attempts to determine if the polygon is viewable.  If the back
of polygon is facing the viewer, then it isn't drawn.  If this
isn't what you want, then use plline3 instead.

n specifies the number of points.  They are assumed to be in a
plane, and the directionality of the plane is determined from the
first three points.  Additional points do not /have/ to lie on the
plane defined by the first three, but if they do not, then the
determiniation of visibility obviously can't be 100% accurate...
So if you're 3 space polygons are too far from planar, consider
breaking them into smaller polygons.  ""3 points define a plane"" :-).

For ifcc == 1, the directionality of the polygon is determined by assuming
the points are laid out in counter-clockwise order.

For ifcc == 0, the directionality of the polygon is determined by assuming
the points are laid out in clockwise order.

BUGS:  If one of the first two segments is of zero length, or if
they are colinear, the calculation of visibility has a 50/50 chance
of being correct.  Avoid such situations :-).  See x18c for an
example of this problem.  (Search for ""20.1"").

! @struct PLOptionInfo
!
! Array of option tables and associated info.
!
! The user may merge up to PL_MAX_OPT_TABLES custom option tables (of type
! PLOptionTable) with the internal one.  The resulting treatment is simple,
! powerful, and robust.  The tables are parsed in the order of last added
! first, to the internal table last.  If multiple options of the same name
! occur, only the first parsed is ""seen"", thus, the user can easily
! override any PLplot internal option merely by providing the same option.
! This same precedence is followed when printing help and usage messages,
! with each set of options given separately.  See example usage in
! plrender.c.

void plhrsh(PLINT ch, PLINT x, PLINT y)
PLINT ch - hershey code to plot
PLINT x - device-world x coordinate of hershey character

Writes the Hershey symbol ""ch"" centred at the physical coordinate (x,y).
This function is now just a ""spoof"" front end to the old plhersh,
which has now been renamed to plhrsh2(). All this function does is
decide whether or not we should render natively as unicode, and then
convert between hershey and unicode.

If the function KNOWS there isn't a unicode equivalent, then it will
try to render it as a hershey font. Understandably, this might make
testing out the unicode functions a little tricky, so if you want
to disable this behaviour, recompile with PL_TEST_FOR_MISSING_GLYPHS
defined.

void plenv()

Simple interface for defining viewport and window.

The ""just"" parameter control how the axes will be scaled:

just=-1 : The scales will not be set, the user must set up the scale
before calling plenv() using plsvpa(), plvasp() or other;
just= 0 : The scales will be set up to optimize plot area;
just= 1 : The scales will be the same;
just= 2 : The axes will be equal, the plot box will be square.

The ""axis"" parameter is interpreted as follows:

axis=-2 : draw no box, no tick marks, no numeric tick labels, no axes.
axis=-1 : draw box only.
axis= 0 : Draw box, ticks, and numeric tick labels.
axis= 1 : Also draw coordinate axes at X=0, and Y=0.
axis= 2 : Also draw a grid at major tick positions in both coordinates.
axis= 3 : Same as 2, but the grid will be also at the minor ticks.
axis=10 : Same as 0 except Logarithmic X tick marks. (The X data have
to be converted to logarithms separately.)

pltr2f()

Does linear interpolation from doubly dimensioned coord arrays
(row dominant, i.e. Fortran ordering).

This routine includes lots of checks for out of bounds.  This would
occur occasionally due to a bug in the contour plotter that is now fixed.
If an out of bounds coordinate is obtained, the boundary value is provided
along with a warning.  These checks should stay since no harm is done if
if everything works correctly.

Killing Mechanism	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
****************************************************************	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
What we assume for a max number of kills.	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
The real variable to look at to find out when to flush kills.	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
Where to store killed text.	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
Where we are in the kill ring.	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
How many slots we have in the kill ring.	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
"How to say that you only want to save a certain amount
   of kill material."	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
"Add TEXT to the kill ring, allocating a new kill ring slot as necessary.
   This uses TEXT directly, so the caller must not free it.  If APPEND is
   non-zero, and the last command was a kill, the text is appended to the
   current kill ring slot, otherwise prepended."	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
First, find the slot to work with.	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
Get a new slot.	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
If we don't have any defined, then make one.	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
"We have to add a new slot on the end, unless we have
	     exceeded the max limit for remembering kills."	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
If the last command was a kill, prepend or append.	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
"The way to kill something.  This appends or prepends to the last
   kill, if the last command was a kill command.  if FROM is less
   than TO, then the text is appended, otherwise prepended.  If the
   last command was not a kill command, then a new slot is made for
   this kill."	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
Is there anything to kill?	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
Delete the copied text from the line.	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
"Now REMEMBER!  In order to do prepending or appending correctly, kill
   commands always make rl_point's original position be the FROM argument,
   and rl_point's extent be the TO argument."	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
****************************************************************	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
Killing Commands	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
****************************************************************	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
Delete the word at point, saving the text in the kill ring.	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
Rubout the word before point, placing it on the kill ring.	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
"Kill from here to the end of the line.  If DIRECTION is negative, kill
   back to the line start instead."	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
"Kill backwards to the start of the line.  If DIRECTION is negative, kill
   forwards to the line end instead."	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
Kill the whole line, no matter where point is.	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
"The next two functions mimic unix line editing behaviour, except they
   save the deleted text on the kill ring.  This is safer than not saving
   it, and since we have a ring, nobody should get screwed."	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
"This does what C-w does in Unix.  We can't prevent people from
   using behaviour that they expect."	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
"This deletes one filename component in a Unix pathname.  That is, it
   deletes backward to directory separator (`/') or whitespace."	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
"Here is C-u doing what Unix does.  You don't *have* to use these
   key-bindings.  We have a choice of killing the entire line, or
   killing from where we are to the start of the line.  We choose the
   latter, because if you are a Unix weenie, then you haven't backspaced
   into the line at all, and if you aren't, then you know what you are
   doing."	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
"Copy the text in the `region' to the kill ring.  If DELETE is non-zero,
   delete the text from the line as well."	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
Copy the text in the region to the kill ring.	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
Kill the text between the point and mark.	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
"Copy COUNT words to the kill ring.  DIR says which direction we look
   to find the words."	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
Yank back the last killed text.  This ignores arguments.	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
"If the last command was yank, or yank_pop, and the text just
   before point is identical to the current kill item, then
   delete that text from the line, rotate the index down, and
   yank back some other text."	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
"Yank the COUNTh argument from the previous history line, skipping
   HISTORY_SKIP lines before looking for the `previous line'."	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
"Vi mode always inserts a space before yanking the argument, and it
     inserts it right *after* rl_point."	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
VI_MODE	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
Yank the COUNTth argument from the previous history line.	repos/server_mariadb/extra/readline/kill.c
"Yank the last argument from the previous history line.  This `knows'
   how rl_yank_nth_arg treats a count of `$'.  With an argument, this

"we need to compare the position of the computed p(x) against the
given point 'p'. We will terminate the iteration and return 'x' if
they are less than eps apart. The question is how to choose eps --
or, put maybe more generally: in which norm we want these 'p' and
'p(x)' to be eps apart.

the question is difficult since we may have to deal with very
elongated cells where we may achieve 1e-12*h for the distance of
these two points in the 'long' direction, but achieving this
tolerance in the 'short' direction of the cell may not be possible

what we do instead is then to terminate iterations if
\| p(x) - p \|_A < eps
where the A-norm is somehow induced by the transformation of the
cell. in particular, we want to measure distances relative to the
sizes of the cell in its principal directions.

to define what exactly A should be, note that to first order we have
the following (assuming that x* is the solution of the problem, i.e.,
p(x*)=p):
p(x) - p = p(x) - p(x*)
= -grad p(x) * (x*-x) + higher order terms
This suggest to measure with a norm that corresponds to
A = {[grad p(x]^T [grad p(x)]}^{-1}
because then
\| p(x) - p \|_A  \approx  \| x - x* \|
Consequently, we will try to enforce that
\| p(x) - p \|_A  =  \| f \|  <=  eps

Note that using this norm is a bit dangerous since the norm changes
in every iteration (A isn't fixed by depends on xk). However, if the
cell is not too deformed (it may be stretched, but not twisted) then
the mapping is almost linear and A is indeed constant or nearly so."	repos/dealii/source/fe/mapping_q_generic.cc

"The dimension-dependent algorithms are much faster (about 25-45x in
2D) but fail most of the time when the given point (p) is not in the
cell. The dimension-independent Newton algorithm given below is
slower, but more robust (though it still sometimes fails). Therefore
this function implements the following strategy based on the
p's dimension:

* In 1D this mapping is linear, so the mapping is always invertible
(and the exact formula is known) as long as the cell has non-zero
length.
* In 2D the exact (quadratic) formula is called first. If either the
exact formula does not succeed (negative discriminant in the
quadratic formula) or succeeds but finds a solution outside of the
unit cell, then the Newton solver is called. The rationale for the
second choice is that the exact formula may provide two different
answers when mapping a point outside of the real cell, but the
Newton solver (if it converges) will only return one answer.
Otherwise the exact formula successfully found a point in the unit
cell and that value is returned.
* In 3D there is no (known to the authors) exact formula, so the Newton
algorithm is used."	repos/dealii/source/fe/mapping_q_generic.cc

element associated with them in the hp context (in the non-hp
context, we can simply assume that the FE space to which we

child to the mother cell into the output vector. unfortunately,
there are two types of elements: ones where you add up the
contributions from the different child cells, and ones where you
overwrite.

an example for the first is piecewise constant (and discontinuous)
elements, where we build the value on the coarse cell by averaging
the values from the cell (i.e. by adding up a fraction of the
values of their values)

an example for the latter are the usual continuous elements. the
value on a vertex of a coarse cell must there be the same,
irrespective of the adjacent cell we are presently on. so we always
overwrite. in fact, we must, since we cannot know in advance how
many neighbors there will be, so there is no way to compute the
average with fixed factors

so we have to find out to which type this element belongs. the
difficulty is: the finite element may be a composed one, so we can
only hope to do this for each shape function individually. in fact,
there are even weird finite elements (for example the
Raviart-Thomas element) which have shape functions that are
additive (interior ones) and others that are overwriting (face

"Otherwise, we can compute the non-cell dependent shape functions.

Note: the local dof numberings follow the usual order of lines ->
faces -> cells
(we have no vertex-based DoFs in this element).
For a given cell we have:
n_line_dofs = dofs_per_line*lines_per_cell.
n_face_dofs = dofs_per_face*faces_per_cell.
n_cell_dofs = dofs_per_quad (2D)
= dofs_per_hex (3D)

i.e. For the local dof numbering:
the first line dof is 0,
the first face dof is n_line_dofs,
the first cell dof is n_line_dofs + n_face_dofs.

On a line, DoFs are ordered first by line_dof and then line_index:
i.e. line_dof_index = line_dof + line_index*(dofs_per_line)

and similarly for faces:
i.e. face_dof_index = face_dof + face_index*(dofs_per_face).

HOWEVER, we have different types of DoFs on a line/face/cell.
On a line we have two types, lowest order and higher order
gradients.
- The numbering is such the lowest order is first, then higher
order.
This is simple enough as there is only 1 lowest order and
degree higher orders DoFs per line.

On a 2D cell, we have 3 types: Type 1/2/3:
- The ordering done by type:
- Type 1: 0 <= i1,j1 < degree. degree^2 in total.
Numbered: ij1 = i1 + j1*(degree).        i.e. cell_dof_index
= ij1.
- Type 2: 0 <= i2,j2 < degree. degree^2 in total.
Numbered: ij2 = i2 + j2*(degree).        i.e. cell_dof_index
= degree^2 + ij2
- Type 3: 0 <= i3 < 2*degree. 2*degree in total.
Numbered: ij3 = i3.                      i.e. cell_dof_index
=  2*(degree^2) + ij3.

These then fit into the local dof numbering described above:
- local dof numberings are:
line_dofs: local_dof = line_dof_index.    0 <= local_dof <
dofs_per_line*lines_per_cell face_dofs: local_dof =
n_line_dofs*lines_per_cell + face_dof_index. cell dofs: local_dof
= n_lines_dof + n_face_dofs + cell_dof_index.

The cell-based shape functions are:

Type 1 (gradients):
\phi^{C_{1}}_{ij) = grad( L_{i+2}(2x-1)L_{j+2}(2y-1) ),

0 <= i,j < degree.

NOTE: The derivative produced by IntegratedLegendrePolynomials does
not account for the
(2*x-1) or (2*y-1) so we must take this into account when

sensitive to the first cell detected. When doing this with multiple

initialized to the first cell the thread sees. As this number might
different between different runs (after all, the tasks are scheduled
dynamically onto threads), this slight deviation leads to difference in
roundoff errors that propagate through the program. Therefore, we need to
disable CellSimilarity in case there is more than one thread in the
problem. This will likely not affect many MPI test cases as there
multithreading is disabled on default, but in many other situations
because we rarely explicitly set the number of threads.

"replace the mapping_qp objects of the base class by something

the boundary description and second compute the points on it. if not at
the boundary, get the respective points from another function"	repos/dealii/source/fe/mapping_c1.cc
"first get the normal vectors at the two vertices of this line
from the boundary description"	repos/dealii/source/fe/mapping_c1.cc
"then transform them into interpolation points for a cubic
polynomial

for this, note that if we describe the boundary curve as a
polynomial in tangential coordinate @p{t=0..1} (along the line)
and @p{s} in normal direction, then the cubic mapping is such
that @p{s = a*t**3 + b*t**2 + c*t + d}, and we want to determine
the interpolation points at @p{t=0.276} and @p{t=0.724}
(Gauss-Lobatto points). Since at @p{t=0,1} we want a vertex which
is actually at the boundary, we know that @p{d=0} and @p{a=-b-c},
which gives @p{s(0.276)} and @p{s(0.726)} in terms of @p{b,c}. As
side-conditions, we want that the derivatives at @p{t=0} and
@p{t=1}, i.e. at the vertices match those returned by the
boundary.

The task is then first to determine the coefficients from the
tangentials. for that, first rotate the tangents of @p{s(t)} into
the global coordinate system. they are @p{A (1,c)} and @p{A
(1,-b-2c)} with @p{A} the rotation matrix, since the tangentials
in the coordinate system relative to the line are @p{(1,c)} and
@p{(1,-b-2c)} at the two vertices, respectively. We then have to
make sure by matching @p{b,c} that these tangentials are
orthogonal to the normals returned by the boundary object"	repos/dealii/source/fe/mapping_c1.cc

1/3 and 2/3, first in unit coordinates"	repos/dealii/source/fe/mapping_c1.cc

"the interpolation process works as follows: on each subface, we want
that finite element solutions from both sides coincide. i.e. if a and b
are expansion coefficients for the shape functions from both sides, we
seek a relation between a and b such that
sum_j a_j phi^c_j(x) == sum_j b_j phi_j(x)
for all points x on the interface. here, phi^c_j are the shape
functions on the small cell on one side of the face, and phi_j those on
the big cell on the other side. To get this relation, it suffices to
look at a sufficient number of points for which this has to hold. if
there are n functions, then we need n evaluation points, and we choose
them equidistantly.

we obtain the matrix system
A a  ==  B b
where
A_ij = phi^c_j(x_i)
B_ij = phi_j(x_i)
and the relation we are looking for is
a = A^-1 B b

for the special case of Lagrange interpolation polynomials, A_ij
reduces to delta_ij, and
a_i = B_ij b_j
Hence, interface_constraints(i,j)=B_ij.

for the general case, where we don't have Lagrange interpolation
polynomials, this is a little more complicated. Then we would evaluate
at a number of points and invert the interpolation matrix A.

Note, that we build up these matrices for all subfaces at once, rather
than considering them separately. the reason is that we finally will

must all be fractions of the unit interval. If we have polynomial
degree 4, the refined element has 8 intervals.  Hence the
coordinates must be 0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.375 etc.  Now the coordinates
of the constraint points will be multiplied by the inverse of the
interval size (in the example by 8).  After that the coordinates
must be integral numbers. Hence a normal truncation is performed
and the coordinates will be scaled back. The equal treatment of all
coordinates should eliminate any FP errors."	repos/dealii/source/fe/fe_q_base.cc
"The following lines of code should eliminate the problems with
the constraints object which appeared for P>=4. The
AffineConstraints class complained about different constraints
for the same entry: Actually, this
difference could be attributed to FP errors, as it was in the
range of 1.0e-16. These errors originate in the loss of
symmetry in the FP approximation of the shape-functions.
Considering a 3rd order shape function in 1D, we have
N0(x)=N3(1-x) and N1(x)=N2(1-x).  For higher order polynomials
the FP approximations of the shape functions do not satisfy
these equations any more!  Thus in the following code
everything is computed in the interval x \in [0..0.5], which is
sufficient to express all values that could come out from a
computation of any shape function in the full interval
[0..1]. If x > 0.5 the computation is done for 1-x with the
shape function N_{p-n} instead of N_n.  Hence symmetry is
preserved and everything works fine...

"for Lagrange interpolation polynomials based on equidistant points,
construction of the restriction matrices is relatively simple. the
reason is that in this case the interpolation points on the mother
cell are always also interpolation points for some shape function on
one or the other child.

in the general case with non-equidistant points, we need to actually
do an interpolation. thus, we take the interpolation points on the
mother cell and evaluate the shape functions of the child cell on
those points. it does not hurt in the equidistant case because then
simple one shape function evaluates to one and the others to zero.

this element is non-additive in all its degrees of freedom by
default, which requires care in downstream use. fortunately, even the
interpolation on non-equidistant points is invariant under the
assumption that whenever a row makes a non-zero contribution to the

"for each cell on the parameter grid: find out which degrees of
freedom on the fine grid correspond in which way to the degrees of
freedom on the parameter grid

since for continuous FEs some dofs exist on more than one cell, we
have to track which ones were already visited. the problem is that if
we visit a dof first on one cell and compute its weight with respect
to some global dofs to be non-zero, and later visit the dof again on
another cell and (since we are on another cell) recompute the weights
with respect to the same dofs as above to be zero now, we have to
preserve them. we therefore overwrite all weights if they are nonzero
and do not enforce zero weights since that might be only due to the
fact that we are on another cell.

example:
coarse grid

*-----*-----*
| cell|cell |
|  1  |  2  |
|     |     |

*--*--*--*--*
|  |  |  |  |
*--x--y--*--*

when on cell 1, we compute the weights of dof 'x' to be 1/2 from
parameter dofs 0 and 1, respectively. however, when later we are on
cell 2, we again compute the prolongation of shape function 1
restricted to cell 2 to the globla grid and find that the weight of
global dof 'x' now is zero. however, we should not overwrite the old
value.

we therefore always only set nonzero values. why adding up is not
useful: dof 'y' would get weight 1 from parameter dof 1 on both cells
1 and 2, but the correct weight is nevertheless only 1."	repos/dealii/source/dofs/dof_tools_constraints.cc

"now that we've got the global representation of each parameter

what we have learned: if entry @p{i} of the global vector holds
the value @p{v[i]}, then this is the weight with which the
present dof contributes to @p{i}. there may be several such
@p{i}s and their weights' sum should be one. Then, @p{v[i]}
should be equal to @p{\sum_j w_{ij} p[j]} with @p{p[j]} be the
values of the degrees of freedom on the coarse grid. we can
thus compute constraints which link the degrees of freedom
@p{v[i]} on the fine grid to those on the coarse grid,
@p{p[j]}. Now to use these as real constraints, rather than as
additional equations, we have to identify representants among
the @p{i} for each @p{j}. this will be done by simply taking
the first @p{i} for which @p{w_{ij}==1}.

order, which are (in accordance with MappingQ) the support points of
QGaussLobatto."	repos/dealii/source/fe/mapping_q_eulerian.cc

to a support point in the undeformed configuration. We can then query
the given displacement field at these points to determine the shift
vector that maps the support points to the deformed configuration."	repos/dealii/source/fe/mapping_q_eulerian.cc
"We assume that the given field contains dim displacement components, but
that there may be other solution components as well (e.g. pressures).
this class therefore assumes that the first dim components represent the
actual shift vector we need, and simply ignores any components after
that. This implies that the user should order components appropriately,
or create a separate dof handler for the displacements."	repos/dealii/source/fe/mapping_q_eulerian.cc

REAL_SCALARS    := { double; float}
COMPLEX_SCALARS := { std::complex<double>;
std::complex<float>}
VECTORS := { Vector<double>; Vector<float>}
--------------------

The input file is typically located in share/deal.II/template-arguments in
the build directory and it is built from cmake/config/template-arguments.in
to contain the list of vectors etc. that make sense for the current
configuration. For example, the list of VECTORS is going to contain PETSc
vectors if so configured.

The second input is read from the command line and consists of a sequence
of statements of the following form:
--------------------
for (u,v:VECTORS; z:SCALARS) { f(u, z, const v &); }
--------------------
Here, everything between {...} will be copied as many times as there are

"now data has been generated, so copy it. we used to work by
looping over all base elements (i.e. this outer loop), then over
multiplicity, then over the shape functions from that base
element, but that requires that we can infer the global number of
a shape function from its number in the base element. for that we
had the component_to_system_table.

however, this does of course no longer work since we have
non-primitive elements. so we go the other way round: loop over
all shape functions of the composed element, and here only treat
those shape functions that belong to a given base element

shape functions. This here is not efficient at all AND very bad style"	repos/dealii/source/fe/fe_system.cc

is only one value to be copied, but for non-primitive

"the layout of the constraints matrix is described in the FiniteElement
class. you may want to look there first before trying to understand the
following, especially the mapping of the @p{m} index.

in order to map it to the fe-system class, we have to know which base
element a degree of freedom within a vertex, line, etc belongs to. this
can be accomplished by the system_to_component_index function in
conjunction with the numbers first_{line,quad,...}_index"	repos/dealii/source/fe/fe_system.cc
"for the pair (n,m) find out which base element they belong to and
the number therein

first for the n index. this is simple since the n indices are in

data type, first value in pair is (base element,instance of base
element), second is index within this instance"	repos/dealii/source/fe/fe_system.cc

here, the second value of face_system_to_base_table can
help: it denotes the face index of that shape function

dof, we can construct the rest: tmp2 will denote the
index of this shape function among the line shape

   wpng - simple PNG-writing program                                 wpng.c

   This program converts certain NetPBM binary files (grayscale and RGB,
   maxval = 255) to PNG.  Non-interlaced PNGs are written progressively;
   interlaced PNGs are read and written in one memory-intensive blast.

   Thanks to Jean-loup Gailly for providing the necessary trick to read
   interactive text from the keyboard while stdin is redirected.  Thanks
   to Cosmin Truta for Cygwin fixes.

   NOTE:  includes provisional support for PNM type ""8"" (portable alphamap)
          images, presumed to be a 32-bit interleaved RGBA format; no pro-
          vision for possible interleaved grayscale+alpha (16-bit) format.
          THIS IS UNLIKELY TO BECOME AN OFFICIAL NETPBM ALPHA FORMAT!

   to do:
    - delete output file if quit before calling any writepng routines
    - process backspace with -text option under DOS/Win? (currently get ^H)

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Changelog:
    - 1.01:  initial public release
    - 1.02:  modified to allow abbreviated options
    - 1.03:  removed extraneous character from usage screen; fixed bug in
              command-line parsing
    - 1.04:  fixed DOS/OS2/Win32 detection, including partial Cygwin fix
              (see http://home.att.net/~perlspinr/diffs/GregBook_cygwin.diff)
    - 2.00:  dual-licensed (added GNU GPL)
    - 2.01:  check for integer overflow (Glenn R-P)

        [REPORTED BUG (win32 only):  ""contrib/gregbook/wpng.c - cmd line
         dose not work!  In order to do something useful I needed to redirect
         both input and output, with cygwin and with bcc32 as well.  Under
         Linux, the same wpng appears to work fine.  I don't know what is
         the problem.""]

"libpng 1.6 and earlier fixed a bug whereby text chunks were written

    * the same png_info to both png_write_info and png_write_end.  Rather than
    * fixing it by recording the information in the png_struct, or by recording
    * where to write the chunks, the fix made was to change the 'compression'
    * field of the chunk to invalid values, rendering the png_info somewhat
    * useless.
    *
    * The only fix for this given that we use the png_info more than once is to
    * make a copy of the text chunks and png_set_text it each time.  This adds a
    * text chunks, so they get replicated, but only the new set gets written
    * each time.  This uses memory like crazy but there is no way to delete the
    * useless chunks from the png_info.

**************************** STANDARD PNG FILES ****************************	repos/libpng-code/contrib/libtests/pngvalid.c
Standard files - write and save standard files.	repos/libpng-code/contrib/libtests/pngvalid.c
"There are two basic forms of standard images.  Those which attempt to have
 * all the possible pixel values (not possible for 16bpp images, but a range of
 * values are produced) and those which have a range of image sizes.  The former
 * are used for testing transforms, in particular gamma correction and bit
 * reduction and increase.  The latter are reserved for testing the behavior of
 * libpng with respect to 'odd' image sizes - particularly small images where
 * rows become 1 byte and interlace passes disappear.
 *
 * The first, most useful, set are the 'transform' images, the second set of
 * small images are the 'size' images.
 *
 * The transform files are constructed with rows which fit into a 1024 byte row
 * buffer.  This makes allocation easier below.  Further regardless of the file
 * format every row has 128 pixels (giving 1024 bytes for 64bpp formats).
 *
 * Files are stored with no gAMA or sBIT chunks, with a PLTE only when needed
 * and with an ID derived from the colour type, bit depth and interlace type
 * as above (FILEID).  The width (128) and height (variable) are not stored in
 * the FILEID - instead the fields are set to 0, indicating a transform file.
 *
 * The size files ar constructed with rows a maximum of 128 bytes wide, allowing
 * a maximum width of 16 pixels (for the 64bpp case.)  They also have a maximum
 * height of 16 rows.  The width and height are stored in the FILEID and, being
 * non-zero, indicate a size file.
 *
 * Because the PNG filter code is typically the largest CPU consumer within
 * libpng itself there is a tendency to attempt to optimize it.  This results in
 * special case code which needs to be validated.  To cause this to happen the
 * 'size' images are made to use each possible filter, in so far as this is
 * possible for smaller images.
 *
 * For palette image (colour type 3) multiple transform images are stored with
 * the same bit depth to allow testing of more colour combinations -
 * particularly important for testing the gamma code because libpng uses a
 * different code path for palette images.  For size images a single palette is
 * used."	repos/libpng-code/contrib/libtests/pngvalid.c
"Make a 'standard' palette.  Because there are only 256 entries in a palette
 * (maximum) this actually makes a random palette in the hope that enough tests
 * will catch enough errors.  (Note that the same palette isn't produced every
 * time for the same test - it depends on what previous tests have been run -
 * but a given set of arguments to pngvalid will always produce the same palette
 * at the same test!  This is why pseudo-random number generators are useful for
 * testing.)
 *
 * The store must be open for write when this is called, otherwise an internal
 * error will occur.  This routine contains its own magic number seed, so the
 * palettes generated don't change if there are intervening errors (changing the
 * calls to the store_mark seed.)"	repos/libpng-code/contrib/libtests/pngvalid.c

"Because we want to use the same code in both the progressive reader and the
 * sequential reader it is necessary to deal with the fact that the progressive
 * reader callbacks only have one parameter (png_get_progressive_ptr()), so this
 * must contain all the test parameters and all the local variables directly
 * accessible to the sequential reader implementation.
 *
 * The technique adopted is to reinvent part of what Dijkstra termed a
 * 'display'; an array of pointers to the stack frames of enclosing functions so
 * that a nested function definition can access the local (C auto) variables of
 * the functions that contain its definition.  In fact C provides the first
 * pointer (the local variables - the stack frame pointer) and the last (the
 * global variables - the BCPL global vector typically implemented as global
 * addresses), this code requires one more pointer to make the display - the
 * local variables (and function call parameters) of the function that actually
 * invokes either the progressive or sequential reader.
 *
 * Perhaps confusingly this technique is confounded with classes - the
 * 'standard_display' defined here is sub-classed as the 'gamma_display' below.
 * A gamma_display is a standard_display, taking advantage of the ANSI-C
 * requirement that the pointer to the first member of a structure must be the
 * same as the pointer to the structure.  This allows us to reuse standard_
 * functions in the gamma test code; something that could not be done with

"There are three sources of error, firstly the quantization in the
    * file encoding, determined by sbit and/or the file depth, secondly
    * the output (screen) gamma and thirdly the output file encoding.
    *
    * Since this API receives the screen and file gamma in double
    * precision it is possible to calculate an exact answer given an input
    * pixel value.  Therefore we assume that the *input* value is exact -
    * sample/maxsample - calculate the corresponding gamma corrected
    * output to the limits of double precision arithmetic and compare with
    * what libpng returns.
    *
    * Since the library must quantize the output to 8 or 16 bits there is
    * a fundamental limit on the accuracy of the output of +/-.5 - this
    * quantization limit is included in addition to the other limits
    * specified by the parameters to the API.  (Effectively, add .5
    * everywhere.)
    *
    * The behavior of the 'sbit' parameter is defined by section 12.5
    * (sample depth scaling) of the PNG spec.  That section forces the
    * decoder to assume that the PNG values have been scaled if sBIT is
    * present:
    *
    *     png-sample = floor( input-sample * (max-out/max-in) + .5);
    *
    * This means that only a subset of the possible PNG values should
    * appear in the input. However, the spec allows the encoder to use a
    * variety of approximations to the above and doesn't require any
    * restriction of the values produced.
    *
    * Nevertheless the spec requires that the upper 'sBIT' bits of the
    * value stored in a PNG file be the original sample bits.
    * Consequently the code below simply scales the top sbit bits by
    * (1<<sbit)-1 to obtain an original sample value.
    *
    * Because there is limited precision in the input it is arguable that
    * an acceptable result is any valid result from input-.5 to input+.5.
    * The basic tests below do not do this, however if 'use_input_precision'

 *     png-fix-itxt.exe < bad.png > good.png
 *
 * Fixes a PNG file written with libpng-1.6.0 or 1.6.1 that has one or more
 * uncompressed iTXt chunks.  Assumes that the actual length is greater
 * than or equal to the value in the length byte, and that the CRC is
 * correct for the actual length.  This program hunts for the CRC and
 * adjusts the length byte accordingly.  It is not an error to process a
 * PNG file that has no iTXt chunks or one that has valid iTXt chunks;
 * such files will simply be copied.
 *
 * Requires zlib (for crc32 and Z_NULL); build with
 *
 *     gcc -O -o png-fix-itxt png-fix-itxt.c -lz
 *
 * If you need to handle iTXt chunks larger than 500000 kbytes you must

"The strategy here is to run a regular libpng PNG file read but examine the

 * intercepted so that they can be quieted and interpreted.  Interpretation
 * depends on a somewhat risky string match for known error messages; let us
 * hope that this can be fixed in the next version of libpng.
 *
 * The control structure is pointed to by the libpng error pointer.  It contains
 * that set of structures which must persist across multiple read callbacks,
 * which is pretty much everything except the 'zlib' control structure.
 *
 * The file structure is instantiated in the caller of the per-file routine, but

 * called via a call to read_chunk and only exit at a return from process_chunk.

          * NOTE: the whole of this logic depends on the caller of this function
          * only calling it on rows appropriate to the pass.  This function only
          * understands the 'x' logic; the 'y' logic is handled by the caller.
          *
          * The following defines allow generation of compile time constant bit
          * masks for each pixel depth and each possibility of swapped or not
          * swapped bytes.  Pass 'p' is in the range 0..6; 'x', a pixel index,
          * is in the range 0..7; and the result is 1 if the pixel is to be
          * copied in the pass, 0 if not.  'S' is for the sparkle method, 'B'
          * for the block method.
          *
          * With some compilers a compile time expression of the general form:
          *
          *    (shift >= 32) ? (a >> (shift-32)) : (b >> shift)
          *
          * Produces warnings with values of 'shift' in the range 33 to 63
          * because the right hand side of the ?: expression is evaluated by
          * the compiler even though it isn't used.  Microsoft Visual C (various
          * versions) and the Intel C compiler are known to do this.  To avoid
          * this the following macros are used in 1.5.6.  This is a temporary
          * solution to avoid destabilizing the code during the release process."	repos/libpng-code/pngrutil.c
"Return a mask for pass 'p' pixel 'x' at depth 'd'.  The mask is
          * little endian - the first pixel is at bit 0 - however the extra
          * parameter 's' can be set to cause the mask position to be swapped
          * within each byte, to match the PNG format.  This is done by XOR of
          * the shift with 7, 6 or 4 for bit depths 1, 2 and 4."	repos/libpng-code/pngrutil.c

"If a transform is valid on both read and write this implies that if the
 * transform is applied to read it must also be applied on write to produce
 * meaningful data.  This is because these transforms when performed on read
 * produce data with a memory format that does not correspond to a PNG format.
 *
 * Most of these transforms are invertible; after applying the transform on
 * write the result is the original PNG data that would have would have been
 * read if no transform were applied.
 *
 * The exception is _SHIFT, which destroys the low order bits marked as not
 * significant in a PNG with the sBIT chunk.
 *
 * The following table lists, for each transform, the conditions under which it
 * is expected to do anything.  Conditions are defined as follows:
 *
 * 1) Color mask bits required - simply a mask to AND with color_type; one of
 *    these must be present for the transform to fire, except that 0 means
 *    'always'.
 * 2) Color mask bits which must be absent - another mask - none of these must
 *    be present.
 * 3) Bit depths - a mask of component bit depths for the transform to fire.
 * 4) 'read' - the transform works in png_read_png.
 * 5) 'write' - the transform works in png_write_png.
 * 6) PNG_INFO_chunk; a mask of the chunks that must be present for the
 *    transform to fire.  All must be present - the requirement is that
 *    png_get_valid() & mask == mask, so if mask is 0 there is no requirement.

 * The condition refers to the original image state - if multiple transforms are
 * used together it is possible to cause a transform that wouldn't fire on the

 * This file provides a location for all output.  Users who need
 * special handling are expected to write functions that have the same
 * arguments as these and perform similar functions, but that possibly
 * use different output methods.  Note that you shouldn't change these
 * functions, but rather write replacement functions and then change
 * them at run time with png_set_write_fn(...)."	repos/libpng-code/pngwio.c
"Write the data to whatever output you are using.  The default routine
 * writes to a file pointer.  Note that this routine sometimes gets called
 * with very small lengths, so you should implement some kind of simple
 * buffering if you are using unbuffered writes.  This should never be asked
 * to write more than 64K on a 16-bit machine."	repos/libpng-code/pngwio.c
PRIVATE	repos/libpng-code/pngwio.c
NOTE: write_data_fn must not change the buffer!	repos/libpng-code/pngwio.c
"This is the function that does the actual writing of data.  If you are
 * not writing to a standard C stream, you should create a replacement
 * write_data function and use it at run time with png_set_write_fn(), rather
 * than changing the library."	repos/libpng-code/pngwio.c
"This function is called to output any data pending writing (normally
 * to disk).  After png_flush is called, there should be no data pending
 * writing in any buffers."	repos/libpng-code/pngwio.c
PRIVATE	repos/libpng-code/pngwio.c
"This function allows the application to supply new output functions for
 * libpng if standard C streams aren't being used.
 *
 * This function takes as its arguments:
 * png_ptr       - pointer to a png output data structure
 * io_ptr        - pointer to user supplied structure containing info about
 *                 the output functions.  May be NULL.
 * write_data_fn - pointer to a new output function that takes as its
 *                 arguments a pointer to a png_struct, a pointer to
 *                 data to be written, and a 32-bit unsigned int that is
 *                 the number of bytes to be written.  The new write
 *                 function should call png_error(png_ptr, ""Error msg"")
 *                 to exit and output any fatal error messages.  May be
 *                 NULL, in which case libpng's default function will
 *                 be used.
 * flush_data_fn - pointer to a new flush function that takes as its
 *                 arguments a pointer to a png_struct.  After a call to
 *                 the flush function, there should be no data in any buffers
 *                 or pending transmission.  If the output method doesn't do
 *                 any buffering of output, a function prototype must still be
 *                 supplied although it doesn't have to do anything.  If
 *                 PNG_WRITE_FLUSH_SUPPORTED is not defined at libpng compile
 *                 time, output_flush_fn will be ignored, although it must be
 *                 supplied for compatibility.  May be NULL, in which case
 *                 libpng's default function will be used, if
 *                 PNG_WRITE_FLUSH_SUPPORTED is defined.  This is not
 *                 a good idea if io_ptr does not point to a standard
 *                 *FILE structure."	repos/libpng-code/pngwio.c

 * These arrays may be modified if the --accumulate flag is set during the run;

 *
 * Errors in alpha should only occur when converting from a direct format
 * to a colormapped format, when alpha is effectively smashed (so large

 * values.  The fourth entry in the array is used for the alpha error (and it
 * should always be zero for the 'via linear' case since this is never color

 * positive and less than 1.0."	repos/libpng-code/png.c
"The reference white is simply the sum of the end-point (X,Y,Z) vectors,
    * thus:"	repos/libpng-code/png.c
"Check xy and, implicitly, z.  Note that wide gamut color spaces typically
    * have end points with 0 tristimulus values (these are impossible end
    * points, but they are used to cover the possible colors).  We check
    * xy->whitey against 5, not 0, to avoid a possible integer overflow."	repos/libpng-code/png.c
"The reverse calculation is more difficult because the original tristimulus
    * value had 9 independent values (red,green,blue)x(X,Y,Z) however only 8
    * derived values were recorded in the cHRM chunk;
    * (red,green,blue,white)x(x,y).  This loses one degree of freedom and
    * therefore an arbitrary ninth value has to be introduced to undo the
    * original transformations.
    *
    * Think of the original end-points as points in (X,Y,Z) space.  The
    * chromaticity values (c) have the property:
    *
    *           C
    *   c = ---------
    *       X + Y + Z
    *
    * For each c (x,y,z) from the corresponding original C (X,Y,Z).  Thus the
    * three chromaticity values (x,y,z) for each end-point obey the
    * relationship:
    *
    *   x + y + z = 1
    *
    * This describes the plane in (X,Y,Z) space that intersects each axis at the
    * value 1.0; call this the chromaticity plane.  Thus the chromaticity
    * calculation has scaled each end-point so that it is on the x+y+z=1 plane
    * and chromaticity is the intersection of the vector from the origin to the
    * (X,Y,Z) value with the chromaticity plane.
    *
    * To fully invert the chromaticity calculation we would need the three
    * end-point scale factors, (red-scale, green-scale, blue-scale), but these
    * were not recorded.  Instead we calculated the reference white (X,Y,Z) and
    * recorded the chromaticity of this.  The reference white (X,Y,Z) would have
    * given all three of the scale factors since:
    *
    *    color-C = color-c * color-scale
    *    white-C = red-C + green-C + blue-C
    *            = red-c*red-scale + green-c*green-scale + blue-c*blue-scale
    *
    * But cHRM records only white-x and white-y, so we have lost the white scale
    * factor:
    *
    *    white-C = white-c*white-scale
    *
    * To handle this the inverse transformation makes an arbitrary assumption
    * about white-scale:
    *
    *    Assume: white-Y = 1.0
    *    Hence:  white-scale = 1/white-y
    *    Or:     red-Y + green-Y + blue-Y = 1.0
    *
    * Notice the last statement of the assumption gives an equation in three of
    * the nine values we want to calculate.  8 more equations come from the
    * above routine as summarised at the top above (the chromaticity
    * calculation):
    *
    *    Given: color-x = color-X / (color-X + color-Y + color-Z)
    *    Hence: (color-x - 1)*color-X + color.x*color-Y + color.x*color-Z = 0
    *
    * This is 9 simultaneous equations in the 9 variables ""color-C"" and can be
    * solved by Cramer's rule.  Cramer's rule requires calculating 10 9x9 matrix
    * determinants, however this is not as bad as it seems because only 28 of
    * the total of 90 terms in the various matrices are non-zero.  Nevertheless
    * Cramer's rule is notoriously numerically unstable because the determinant
    * calculation involves the difference of large, but similar, numbers.  It is
    * difficult to be sure that the calculation is stable for real world values
    * and it is certain that it becomes unstable where the end points are close
    * together.
    *
    * So this code uses the perhaps slightly less optimal but more
    * understandable and totally obvious approach of calculating color-scale.
    *
    * This algorithm depends on the precision in white-scale and that is
    * (1/white-y), so we can immediately see that as white-y approaches 0 the
    * accuracy inherent in the cHRM chunk drops off substantially.
    *
    * libpng arithmetic: a simple inversion of the above equations
    * ------------------------------------------------------------
    *
    *    white_scale = 1/white-y
    *    white-X = white-x * white-scale
    *    white-Y = 1.0
    *    white-Z = (1 - white-x - white-y) * white_scale
    *
    *    white-C = red-C + green-C + blue-C
    *            = red-c*red-scale + green-c*green-scale + blue-c*blue-scale
    *
    * This gives us three equations in (red-scale,green-scale,blue-scale) where
    * all the coefficients are now known:
    *
    *    red-x*red-scale + green-x*green-scale + blue-x*blue-scale
    *       = white-x/white-y
    *    red-y*red-scale + green-y*green-scale + blue-y*blue-scale = 1
    *    red-z*red-scale + green-z*green-scale + blue-z*blue-scale
    *       = (1 - white-x - white-y)/white-y
    *
    * In the last equation color-z is (1 - color-x - color-y) so we can add all
    * three equations together to get an alternative third:
    *
    *    red-scale + green-scale + blue-scale = 1/white-y = white-scale
    *
    * So now we have a Cramer's rule solution where the determinants are just
    * 3x3 - far more tractible.  Unfortunately 3x3 determinants still involve
    * multiplication of three coefficients so we can't guarantee to avoid
    * overflow in the libpng fixed point representation.  Using Cramer's rule in
    * floating point is probably a good choice here, but it's not an option for
    * fixed point.  Instead proceed to simplify the first two equations by
    * eliminating what is likely to be the largest value, blue-scale:
    *
    *    blue-scale = white-scale - red-scale - green-scale
    *
    * Hence:
    *
    *    (red-x - blue-x)*red-scale + (green-x - blue-x)*green-scale =
    *                (white-x - blue-x)*white-scale
    *
    *    (red-y - blue-y)*red-scale + (green-y - blue-y)*green-scale =
    *                1 - blue-y*white-scale
    *
    * And now we can trivially solve for (red-scale,green-scale):
    *
    *    green-scale =
    *                (white-x - blue-x)*white-scale - (red-x - blue-x)*red-scale
    *                -----------------------------------------------------------
    *                                  green-x - blue-x
    *
    *    red-scale =
    *                1 - blue-y*white-scale - (green-y - blue-y) * green-scale
    *                ---------------------------------------------------------
    *                                  red-y - blue-y
    *
    * Hence:
    *
    *    red-scale =
    *          ( (green-x - blue-x) * (white-y - blue-y) -
    *            (green-y - blue-y) * (white-x - blue-x) ) / white-y
    * -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    *  (green-x - blue-x)*(red-y - blue-y)-(green-y - blue-y)*(red-x - blue-x)
    *
    *    green-scale =
    *          ( (red-y - blue-y) * (white-x - blue-x) -
    *            (red-x - blue-x) * (white-y - blue-y) ) / white-y
    * -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    *  (green-x - blue-x)*(red-y - blue-y)-(green-y - blue-y)*(red-x - blue-x)
    *
    * Accuracy:
    * The input values have 5 decimal digits of accuracy.  The values are all in
    * the range 0 < value < 1, so simple products are in the same range but may
    * need up to 10 decimal digits to preserve the original precision and avoid
    * underflow.  Because we are using a 32-bit signed representation we cannot
    * match this; the best is a little over 9 decimal digits, less than 10.
    *
    * The approach used here is to preserve the maximum precision within the
    * signed representation.  Because the red-scale calculation above uses the
    * difference between two products of values that must be in the range -1..+1
    * it is sufficient to divide the product by 7; ceil(100,000/32767*2).  The
    * factor is irrelevant in the calculation because it is applied to both
    * numerator and denominator.
    *
    * Note that the values of the differences of the products of the
    * chromaticities in the above equations tend to be small, for example for
    * the sRGB chromaticities they are:
    *
    * red numerator:    -0.04751

 * Poynton's current link (as of January 2003 through July 2011):

 * has changed the numbers slightly:
 *
 *     Y = 0.2126*R + 0.7152*G + 0.0722*B
 *
 *  which can be expressed with integers as
 *
 *     Y = (6966 * R + 23436 * G + 2366 * B)/32768
 *
 *  Historically, however, libpng uses numbers derived from the ITU-R Rec 709
 *  end point chromaticities and the D65 white point.  Depending on the
 *  precision used for the D65 white point this produces a variety of different
 *  numbers, however if the four decimal place value used in ITU-R Rec 709 is
 *  used (0.3127,0.3290) the Y calculation would be:
 *
 *     Y = (6968 * R + 23435 * G + 2366 * B)/32768
 *
 *  While this is correct the rounding results in an overflow for white, because
 *  the sum of the rounded coefficients is 32769, not 32768.  Consequently
 *  libpng uses, instead, the closest non-overflowing approximation:
 *
 *     Y = (6968 * R + 23434 * G + 2366 * B)/32768
 *
 *  Starting with libpng-1.5.5, if the image being converted has a cHRM chunk
 *  (including an sRGB chunk) then the chromaticities are used to calculate the
 *  coefficients.  See the chunk handling in pngrutil.c for more information.
 *
 *  In all cases the calculation is to be done in a linear colorspace.  If no
 *  gamma information is available to correct the encoding of the original RGB
 *  values this results in an implicit assumption that the original PNG RGB
 *  values were linear.
 *
 *  Other integer coefficients can be used via png_set_rgb_to_gray().  Because
 *  the API takes just red and green coefficients the blue coefficient is
 *  calculated to make the sum 32768.  This will result in different rounding
 *  to that used above."	repos/libpng-code/pngrtran.c

"From Andreas Dilger e-mail to png-implement, 26 March 1998:
 *
 *   In most cases, the ""simple transparency"" should be done prior to doing
 *   gray-to-RGB, or you will have to test 3x as many bytes to check if a
 *   pixel is transparent.  You would also need to make sure that the
 *   transparency information is upgraded to RGB.
 *
 *   To summarize, the current flow is:
 *   - Gray + simple transparency -> compare 1 or 2 gray bytes and composite
 *                                   with background ""in place"" if transparent,
 *                                   convert to RGB if necessary
 *   - Gray + alpha -> composite with gray background and remove alpha bytes,
 *                                   convert to RGB if necessary
 *
 *   To support RGB backgrounds for gray images we need:
 *   - Gray + simple transparency -> convert to RGB + simple transparency,
 *                                   compare 3 or 6 bytes and composite with
 *                                   background ""in place"" if transparent
 *                                   (3x compare/pixel compared to doing
 *                                   composite with gray bkgrnd)
 *   - Gray + alpha -> convert to RGB + alpha, composite with background and
 *                                   remove alpha bytes (3x float
 *                                   operations/pixel compared with composite
 *                                   on gray background)
 *
 *  Greg's change will do this.  The reason it wasn't done before is for
 *  performance, as this increases the per-pixel operations.  If we would check
 *  in advance if the background was gray or RGB, and position the gray-to-RGB
 *  transform appropriately, then it would save a lot of work/time."	repos/libpng-code/pngrtran.c

       * RGB_TO_GRAY will do the transform."	repos/libpng-code/pngrtran.c
at_start == false, because SWAP_ALPHA happens later	repos/libpng-code/pngrtran.c
"There is no harm in doing both of these because only one has any effect,
