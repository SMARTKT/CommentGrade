           1/ locally enumerate dofs on locally owned cells

              un-numerate those that are on interfaces with ghost

Draws a linear gradient at an angle relative to the increasing x

expressed using colour and transparency information from cmap1.  The
geometrical gradient direction is specified by the angle argument.
The 0. to 1. range of the independent variable of cmap1 corresponds
to the range of the polygon in the direction specified by angle.

The array data is indexed like data[ix][iy]

xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax:
data[0][0] corresponds to (xmin,ymin)
data[nx-1][ny-1] to (xmax,ymax)

zmin, zmax:
only data within bounds zmin <= data <= zmax will be
plotted. If zmin == zmax, all data will be ploted.

valuemin, valuemax:
The minimum and maximum values to use for value -> color
mappings.  A value in idata of valuemin or less will have
color 0.0 and a value in idata of valuemax or greater will
have color 1.0.  Values between valuemin and valuemax will
map linearly to to the colors between 0.0 and 1.0.
If you do not want to display values outside of the
(valuemin -> valuemax) range, then set zmin = valuemin and
zmax = valuemax.
This allows for multiple plots to use the same color scale

Fills a polygon from points in x[] and y[] with all points in

Note, undefined regions that are confined to the areas between polygon
points are completely ignored.  Also, a range of undefined polygon points
are simply replaced with a straight line with accurately bisected end
points.  So this routine can produce problematic plotted results
if the polygon is not a lot smaller than the typical resolution of
the defined region.

PLINT sh_color, PLFLT sh_width, PLINT min_color, PLFLT min_width,
PLINT max_color, PLFLT max_width, void (*fill)(), PLINT
rectangular, ...)

arguments:

PLFLT &(a[0][0])

Contains array to be plotted. The array must have been declared as
PLFLT a[nx][ny].  See following note on fortran-style arrays.

PLINT nx, ny

Dimension of array ""a"".

char &(defined[0][0])

Contains array of flags, 1 = data is valid, 0 = data is not valid.
This array determines which sections of the data is to be plotted.
This argument can be NULL if all the values are valid.  Must have been
declared as char defined[nx][ny].

PLFLT xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax

Defines the ""grid"" coordinates.  The data a[0][0] has a position of
(xmin,ymin).

void (*mapform)()

Transformation from `grid' coordinates to world coordinates.  This
pointer to a function can be NULL in which case the grid coordinates
are the same as the world coordinates.

PLFLT shade_min, shade_max

Defines the interval to be shaded. If shade_max <= shade_min, plshade
does nothing.

PLINT sh_cmap, PLFLT sh_color, PLFLT sh_width

Defines color map, color map index, and width used by the fill pattern.

PLINT min_color, PLFLT min_width, PLINT max_color, PLFLT max_width

Defines pen color, width used by the boundary of shaded region. The min
values are used for the shade_min boundary, and the max values are used
on the shade_max boundary.  Set color and width to zero for no plotted
boundaries.

void (*fill)()

Routine used to fill the region.  Use plfill.  Future version of plplot
may have other fill routines.

PLINT rectangular

Flag. Set to 1 if rectangles map to rectangles after (*mapform)() else
set to zero. If rectangular is set to 1, plshade tries to save time by
filling large rectangles.  This optimization fails if (*mapform)()
distorts the shape of rectangles.  For example a plot in polor
coordinates has to have rectangular set to zero.

Example mapform's:

Grid to world coordinate transformation.
This example goes from a r-theta to x-y for a polar plot.

void mapform(PLINT n, PLFLT *x, PLFLT *y) {
int i;
double r, theta;
for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
r = x[i];
theta = y[i];
x[i] = r*cos(theta);
y[i] = r*sin(theta);
}
}

Grid was in cm, convert to world coordinates in inches.
Expands in x direction.

void mapform(PLINT n, PLFLT *x, PLFLT *y) {
int i;
for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
x[i] = (1.0 / 2.5) * x[i];
y[i] = (1.0 / 2.5) * y[i];
}

polynomial

for this, note that if we describe the boundary curve as a
polynomial in tangential coordinate @p{t=0..1} (along the line)
and @p{s} in normal direction, then the cubic mapping is such
that @p{s = a*t**3 + b*t**2 + c*t + d}, and we want to determine
the interpolation points at @p{t=0.276} and @p{t=0.724}
(Gauss-Lobatto points). Since at @p{t=0,1} we want a vertex which
is actually at the boundary, we know that @p{d=0} and @p{a=-b-c},
which gives @p{s(0.276)} and @p{s(0.726)} in terms of @p{b,c}. As
side-conditions, we want that the derivatives at @p{t=0} and
@p{t=1}, i.e. at the vertices match those returned by the
boundary.

The task is then first to determine the coefficients from the
tangentials. for that, first rotate the tangents of @p{s(t)} into
the global coordinate system. they are @p{A (1,c)} and @p{A
(1,-b-2c)} with @p{A} the rotation matrix, since the tangentials
in the coordinate system relative to the line are @p{(1,c)} and
@p{(1,-b-2c)} at the two vertices, respectively. We then have to
make sure by matching @p{b,c} that these tangentials are
orthogonal to the normals returned by the boundary object"	2	2

Does linear interpolation from doubly dimensioned coord arrays (column

This routine includes lots of checks for out of bounds.  This would occur
occasionally due to some bugs in the contour plotter (now fixed).  If an
out of bounds coordinate is obtained, the boundary value is provided
along with a warning.  These checks should stay since no harm is done if

the 1d-values. this gives us a linear growth in degree*dim,

the embedding matrix is given by applying the inverse of

Note: the local dof numberings follow the usual order of lines ->
faces -> cells
(we have no vertex-based DoFs in this element).
For a given cell we have:
n_line_dofs = dofs_per_line*lines_per_cell.
n_face_dofs = dofs_per_face*faces_per_cell.
n_cell_dofs = dofs_per_quad (2D)
= dofs_per_hex (3D)

i.e. For the local dof numbering:
the first line dof is 0,
the first face dof is n_line_dofs,
the first cell dof is n_line_dofs + n_face_dofs.

On a line, DoFs are ordered first by line_dof and then line_index:
i.e. line_dof_index = line_dof + line_index*(dofs_per_line)

and similarly for faces:
i.e. face_dof_index = face_dof + face_index*(dofs_per_face).

HOWEVER, we have different types of DoFs on a line/face/cell.
On a line we have two types, lowest order and higher order
gradients.
- The numbering is such the lowest order is first, then higher
order.
This is simple enough as there is only 1 lowest order and
degree higher orders DoFs per line.

On a 2D cell, we have 3 types: Type 1/2/3:
- The ordering done by type:
- Type 1: 0 <= i1,j1 < degree. degree^2 in total.
Numbered: ij1 = i1 + j1*(degree).        i.e. cell_dof_index
= ij1.
- Type 2: 0 <= i2,j2 < degree. degree^2 in total.
Numbered: ij2 = i2 + j2*(degree).        i.e. cell_dof_index
= degree^2 + ij2
- Type 3: 0 <= i3 < 2*degree. 2*degree in total.
Numbered: ij3 = i3.                      i.e. cell_dof_index
=  2*(degree^2) + ij3.

These then fit into the local dof numbering described above:
- local dof numberings are:
line_dofs: local_dof = line_dof_index.    0 <= local_dof <
dofs_per_line*lines_per_cell face_dofs: local_dof =
n_line_dofs*lines_per_cell + face_dof_index. cell dofs: local_dof
= n_lines_dof + n_face_dofs + cell_dof_index.

The cell-based shape functions are:

Type 1 (gradients):
\phi^{C_{1}}_{ij) = grad( L_{i+2}(2x-1)L_{j+2}(2y-1) ),

0 <= i,j < degree.

NOTE: The derivative produced by IntegratedLegendrePolynomials does
not account for the
(2*x-1) or (2*y-1) so we must take this into account when

    * file encoding, determined by sbit and/or the file depth, secondly
    * the output (screen) gamma and thirdly the output file encoding.
    *
    * Since this API receives the screen and file gamma in double
    * precision it is possible to calculate an exact answer given an input
    * pixel value.  Therefore we assume that the *input* value is exact -
    * sample/maxsample - calculate the corresponding gamma corrected
    * output to the limits of double precision arithmetic and compare with
    * what libpng returns.
    *
    * Since the library must quantize the output to 8 or 16 bits there is
    * a fundamental limit on the accuracy of the output of +/-.5 - this
    * quantization limit is included in addition to the other limits
    * specified by the parameters to the API.  (Effectively, add .5
    * everywhere.)
    *
    * The behavior of the 'sbit' parameter is defined by section 12.5
    * (sample depth scaling) of the PNG spec.  That section forces the
    * decoder to assume that the PNG values have been scaled if sBIT is
    * present:
    *
    *     png-sample = floor( input-sample * (max-out/max-in) + .5);
    *
    * This means that only a subset of the possible PNG values should
    * appear in the input. However, the spec allows the encoder to use a
    * variety of approximations to the above and doesn't require any
    * restriction of the values produced.
    *
    * Nevertheless the spec requires that the upper 'sBIT' bits of the
    * value stored in a PNG file be the original sample bits.
    * Consequently the code below simply scales the top sbit bits by
    * (1<<sbit)-1 to obtain an original sample value.
    *
    * Because there is limited precision in the input it is arguable that
    * an acceptable result is any valid result from input-.5 to input+.5.
    * The basic tests below do not do this, however if 'use_input_precision'
    * is set a subsequent test is performed above."	2	2

 * ----------------------------------
 *
 * This program is a single-threaded process.
 *
 * This program is intended to be highly portable and as such it must be kept
 * as simple as possible, due to this the only signal handling mechanisms used
 * will be those of ANSI C, and used only in the most basic form which is good
 * enough for the purpose of this program.
 *
 * For the above reason and the specific needs of this program signals SIGHUP,
 * SIGPIPE and SIGALRM will be simply ignored on systems where this can be
 * done.  If possible, signals SIGINT and SIGTERM will be handled by this
 * program as an indication to cleanup and finish execution as soon as
 * possible.  This will be achieved with a single signal handler
 * 'exit_signal_handler' for both signals.
 *
 * The 'exit_signal_handler' upon the first SIGINT or SIGTERM received signal
 * will just set to one the global var 'got_exit_signal' storing in global var
 * 'exit_signal' the signal that triggered this change.
 *
 * Nothing fancy that could introduce problems is used, the program at certain
 * points in its normal flow checks if var 'got_exit_signal' is set and in
 * case this is true it just makes its way out of loops and functions in
 * structured and well behaved manner to achieve proper program cleanup and
 * termination.
 *
 * Even with the above mechanism implemented it is worthwile to note that
 * other signals might still be received, or that there might be systems on
 * which it is not possible to trap and ignore some of the above signals.
 * This implies that for increased portability and reliability the program
 * must be coded as if no signal was being ignored or handled at all.  Enjoy
 * it!"	2	2

void plpoly3( n, x, y, z, draw, ifcc )

Draws a polygon in 3 space.  This differs from plline3() in that
this attempts to determine if the polygon is viewable.  If the back
of polygon is facing the viewer, then it isn't drawn.  If this
isn't what you want, then use plline3 instead.

n specifies the number of points.  They are assumed to be in a
plane, and the directionality of the plane is determined from the
first three points.  Additional points do not /have/ to lie on the
plane defined by the first three, but if they do not, then the
determiniation of visibility obviously can't be 100% accurate...
So if you're 3 space polygons are too far from planar, consider
breaking them into smaller polygons.  ""3 points define a plane"" :-).

For ifcc == 1, the directionality of the polygon is determined by assuming
the points are laid out in counter-clockwise order.

For ifcc == 0, the directionality of the polygon is determined by assuming
the points are laid out in clockwise order.

BUGS:  If one of the first two segments is of zero length, or if
they are colinear, the calculation of visibility has a 50/50 chance
of being correct.  Avoid such situations :-).  See x18c for an
example of this problem.  (Search for ""20.1"").

 * This program reads in a PNG image, writes it out again, and then

 * the basic chunk handling, filtering, and (de)compression code is working
 * properly.  It does not currently test all of the transforms, although
 * it probably should.
 *
 * The program will report ""FAIL"" in certain legitimate cases:
 * 1) when the compression level or filter selection method is changed.
 * 2) when the maximum IDAT size (PNG_ZBUF_SIZE in pngconf.h) is not 8192.
 * 3) unknown unsafe-to-copy ancillary chunks or unknown critical chunks
 *    exist in the input file.
 * 4) others not listed here...
 * In these cases, it is best to check with another tool such as ""pngcheck""
 * to see what the differences between the two files are.
 *
 * If a filename is given on the command-line, then this file is used
 * for the input, rather than the default ""pngtest.png"".  This allows
 * testing a wide variety of files easily.  You can also test a number
 * of files at once by typing ""pngtest -m file1.png file2.png ..."""	1	1

Follow polygon 1 (checking intersections with polygon 2 for each
segment of polygon 1) until you have accumulated two
intersections with polygon 2.  Here is an ascii-art illustration
of the situation.


2???2

""1"" marks polygon 1 vertices, ""2"" marks polygon 2 vertices, ""X""
marks the intersections, ""---"" stands for part of polygon 1
that has been previously searched for all possible intersections
from index 0, and ""..."" means polygon 1 continues
with more potential intersections above and/or below this diagram
before it finally hooks back to connect with the index 0 vertex.
""2???2"" stands for parts of polygon 2 that must connect with each other
(since the polygon 1 path between the two intersections is
known to be free of intersections.)

Polygon 2 is split at the boundary defined by the two
intersections and all (in this case three) polygon 1 vertices
between the two intersections for the next recursion level.  We
absolutely know for that boundary that no more intersections can
occur (both polygon 1 and polygon 2 are guaranteed not to
self-intersect) so we mark the status of those vertices with that
information so those polygon 2 split vertices will not be used to
search for further intersections at deeper recursion levels.
Note, we know nothing about whether the remaining ""2???2"" parts of the
split polygon 2 intersect with polygon 1 or not so those will
continued to be searched at deeper recursion levels. At the same
time, we absolutely know that the part of polygon 1 to the left of
rightmost x down to and including index 0 cannot yield more
intersections with any split of polygon 2 so we adjust the lower
limit of polygon 1 to be used for intersection searches at deeper
recursion levels.  The result should be that at sufficiently deep
recursion depth we always end up with the case that there are no
intersections to be found between polygon 1 and some polygon 2
split, and in that case we move on to the end phase below.

different between different runs (after all, the tasks are scheduled
dynamically onto threads), this slight deviation leads to difference in
roundoff errors that propagate through the program. Therefore, we need to
disable CellSimilarity in case there is more than one thread in the
problem. This will likely not affect many MPI test cases as there
multithreading is disabled on default, but in many other situations

 * must contain all the test parameters and all the local variables directly
 * accessible to the sequential reader implementation.
 *
 * The technique adopted is to reinvent part of what Dijkstra termed a
 * 'display'; an array of pointers to the stack frames of enclosing functions so
 * that a nested function definition can access the local (C auto) variables of
 * the functions that contain its definition.  In fact C provides the first

 * addresses), this code requires one more pointer to make the display - the
 * local variables (and function call parameters) of the function that actually
 * invokes either the progressive or sequential reader.
 *
 * Perhaps confusingly this technique is confounded with classes - the
 * 'standard_display' defined here is sub-classed as the 'gamma_display' below.
 * A gamma_display is a standard_display, taking advantage of the ANSI-C
 * requirement that the pointer to the first member of a structure must be the

the constraints object which appeared for P>=4. The
AffineConstraints class complained about different constraints
for the same entry: Actually, this
difference could be attributed to FP errors, as it was in the
range of 1.0e-16. These errors originate in the loss of
symmetry in the FP approximation of the shape-functions.
Considering a 3rd order shape function in 1D, we have
N0(x)=N3(1-x) and N1(x)=N2(1-x).  For higher order polynomials
the FP approximations of the shape functions do not satisfy
these equations any more!  Thus in the following code
everything is computed in the interval x \in [0..0.5], which is
sufficient to express all values that could come out from a
computation of any shape function in the full interval
[0..1]. If x > 0.5 the computation is done for 1-x with the
shape function N_{p-n} instead of N_n.  Hence symmetry is
preserved and everything works fine...

For a different explanation of the problem, see the discussion
in the FiniteElement class for constraint matrices in 3d."	2	2

 *
 * o We want IPv6 support for systems that provide it, and doing optional IPv6
 *   support in perl seems if not impossible so at least awkward.

 * o We want FTP-SSL support, which means that a connection that starts with

repos/libpng-code/pngrtran.c	"From Andreas Dilger e-mail to png-implement, 26 March 1998:
 *
 *   In most cases, the ""simple transparency"" should be done prior to doing
 *   gray-to-RGB, or you will have to test 3x as many bytes to check if a
 *   pixel is transparent.  You would also need to make sure that the
 *   transparency information is upgraded to RGB.
 *
 *   To summarize, the current flow is:
 *   - Gray + simple transparency -> compare 1 or 2 gray bytes and composite
 *                                   with background ""in place"" if transparent,
 *                                   convert to RGB if necessary
 *   - Gray + alpha -> composite with gray background and remove alpha bytes,
 *                                   convert to RGB if necessary
 *
 *   To support RGB backgrounds for gray images we need:
 *   - Gray + simple transparency -> convert to RGB + simple transparency,
 *                                   compare 3 or 6 bytes and composite with
 *                                   background ""in place"" if transparent
 *                                   (3x compare/pixel compared to doing
 *                                   composite with gray bkgrnd)
 *   - Gray + alpha -> convert to RGB + alpha, composite with background and
 *                                   remove alpha bytes (3x float
 *                                   operations/pixel compared with composite
 *                                   on gray background)
 *
 *  Greg's change will do this.  The reason it wasn't done before is for
 *  performance, as this increases the per-pixel operations.  If we would check
 *  in advance if the background was gray or RGB, and position the gray-to-RGB
 *  transform appropriately, then it would save a lot of work/time."	2	2

arguments:

PLFLT &(a[0][0])

Contains array to be plotted. The array must have been declared as
PLFLT a[nx][ny].  See following note on fortran-style arrays.

PLINT nx, ny

Dimension of array ""a"".

char &(defined[0][0])

Contains array of flags, 1 = data is valid, 0 = data is not valid.
This array determines which sections of the data is to be plotted.
This argument can be NULL if all the values are valid.  Must have been
declared as char defined[nx][ny].

PLFLT xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax

Defines the ""grid"" coordinates.  The data a[0][0] has a position of
(xmin,ymin).

void (*mapform)()

Transformation from `grid' coordinates to world coordinates.  This
pointer to a function can be NULL in which case the grid coordinates
are the same as the world coordinates.

PLFLT shade_min, shade_max

Defines the interval to be shaded. If shade_max <= shade_min, plshade
does nothing.

PLINT sh_cmap, PLFLT sh_color, PLFLT sh_width

Defines color map, color map index, and width used by the fill pattern.

PLINT min_color, PLFLT min_width, PLINT max_color, PLFLT max_width

Defines pen color, width used by the boundary of shaded region. The min
values are used for the shade_min boundary, and the max values are used
on the shade_max boundary.  Set color and width to zero for no plotted
boundaries.

void (*fill)()

Routine used to fill the region.  Use plfill.  Future version of plplot
may have other fill routines.

PLINT rectangular

Flag. Set to 1 if rectangles map to rectangles after (*mapform)() else
set to zero. If rectangular is set to 1, plshade tries to save time by
filling large rectangles.  This optimization fails if (*mapform)()
distorts the shape of rectangles.  For example a plot in polor
coordinates has to have rectangular set to zero.

Example mapform's:

Grid to world coordinate transformation.
This example goes from a r-theta to x-y for a polar plot.

void mapform(PLINT n, PLFLT *x, PLFLT *y) {
int i;
double r, theta;
for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
r = x[i];
theta = y[i];
x[i] = r*cos(theta);
y[i] = r*sin(theta);
}
}

Grid was in cm, convert to world coordinates in inches.
Expands in x direction.

void mapform(PLINT n, PLFLT *x, PLFLT *y) {
int i;
for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
x[i] = (1.0 / 2.5) * x[i];
y[i] = (1.0 / 2.5) * y[i];
}
}

repos/dealii/source/fe/fe_q_base.cc	"for Lagrange interpolation polynomials based on equidistant points,
construction of the restriction matrices is relatively simple. the
reason is that in this case the interpolation points on the mother
cell are always also interpolation points for some shape function on
one or the other child.

in the general case with non-equidistant points, we need to actually
do an interpolation. thus, we take the interpolation points on the
mother cell and evaluate the shape functions of the child cell on
those points. it does not hurt in the equidistant case because then
simple one shape function evaluates to one and the others to zero.

this element is non-additive in all its degrees of freedom by
default, which requires care in downstream use. fortunately, even the
interpolation on non-equidistant points is invariant under the
assumption that whenever a row makes a non-zero contribution to the
mother's residual, the correct value is interpolated."	2	2

arguments are
idata: array containing image data
nx: dimension of the array in the X axis.
ny: dimension of the  array in the Y axis
The array data is indexed like data[ix][iy]

xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax:
data[0][0] corresponds to (xmin,ymin)
data[nx-1][ny-1] to (xmax,ymax)

zmin, zmax:
only data within bounds zmin <= data <= zmax will be
plotted. If zmin == zmax, all data will be ploted.

valuemin, valuemax:
The minimum and maximum values to use for value -> color
mappings.  A value in idata of valuemin or less will have
color 0.0 and a value in idata of valuemax or greater will
have color 1.0.  Values between valuemin and valuemax will
map linearly to to the colors between 0.0 and 1.0.
If you do not want to display values outside of the
(valuemin -> valuemax) range, then set zmin = valuemin and
zmax = valuemax.
This allows for multiple plots to use the same color scale

freedom on the fine grid correspond in which way to the degrees of
freedom on the parameter grid

since for continuous FEs some dofs exist on more than one cell, we
have to track which ones were already visited. the problem is that if
we visit a dof first on one cell and compute its weight with respect
to some global dofs to be non-zero, and later visit the dof again on
another cell and (since we are on another cell) recompute the weights
with respect to the same dofs as above to be zero now, we have to
preserve them. we therefore overwrite all weights if they are nonzero
and do not enforce zero weights since that might be only due to the
fact that we are on another cell.

example:
coarse grid
|     |     |
*-----*-----*
| cell|cell |
|  1  |  2  |
|     |     |
0-----1-----*

fine grid

*--*--*--*--*
|  |  |  |  |
*--*--*--*--*
|  |  |  |  |
*--x--y--*--*

when on cell 1, we compute the weights of dof 'x' to be 1/2 from
parameter dofs 0 and 1, respectively. however, when later we are on
cell 2, we again compute the prolongation of shape function 1
restricted to cell 2 to the globla grid and find that the weight of
global dof 'x' now is zero. however, we should not overwrite the old
value.

we therefore always only set nonzero values. why adding up is not
useful: dof 'y' would get weight 1 from parameter dof 1 on both cells
1 and 2, but the correct weight is nevertheless only 1."	2	2

Adjust for the descender - make sure the font is nice and centred
vertically. Freetype assumes we have a base-line, but plplot thinks of
centre-lines, so that's why we have to do this. Since this is one of our
own adjustments, rather than a freetype one, we have to run it through
the transform matrix manually.

For some odd reason, this works best if we triple the
descender's height and then adjust the height later on...
Don't ask me why, 'cause I don't know. But it does seem to work.

I really wish I knew *why* it worked better though...

void plsurf3dl(x, y, z, nx, ny, opt, clevel, nlevel,
indexxmin, indexxmax, indexymin, indexymax)

Plots the 3-d surface representation of the function z[x][y].
The x values are stored as x[0..nx-1], the y values as y[0..ny-1],
and the z values are in the 2-d array z[][].


BASE_CONT    draw contour plot at bottom xy plane
TOP_CONT     draw contour plot at top xy plane (not implemented)
SURF_CONT    draw contour at surface
FACETED      each square that makes up the surface is faceted
DRAW_SIDES   draw sides
MAG_COLOR    the surface is colored according to the value of z;
if not defined, the surface is colored according to the
intensity of the reflected light in the surface from a light
source whose position is set using c_pllightsource()

or any bitwise combination, e.g. ""MAG_COLOR | SURF_CONT | BASE_CONT""

indexymin and indexymax are arrays which specify the y index range
(following the convention that the upper range limit is one more than
actual index limit) for an x index range of indexxmin, indexxmax.
This code is a complete departure from the approach taken in the old version
of this routine. Formerly to code attempted to use the logic for the hidden
line algorithm to draw the hidden surface. This was really hard. This code
below uses a simple back to front (painters) algorithm. All the
triangles are drawn.

There are multitude of ways this code could be optimized. Given the
problems with the old code, I tried to focus on clarity here.

repos/dealii/source/dofs/dof_accessor_get.cc	"later on we will have to push the values interpolated from the
child to the mother cell into the output vector. unfortunately,
there are two types of elements: ones where you add up the
contributions from the different child cells, and ones where you
overwrite.

an example for the first is piecewise constant (and discontinuous)
elements, where we build the value on the coarse cell by averaging
the values from the cell (i.e. by adding up a fraction of the
values of their values)

an example for the latter are the usual continuous elements. the
value on a vertex of a coarse cell must there be the same,
irrespective of the adjacent cell we are presently on. so we always
overwrite. in fact, we must, since we cannot know in advance how
many neighbors there will be, so there is no way to compute the
average with fixed factors

so we have to find out to which type this element belongs. the
difficulty is: the finite element may be a composed one, so we can
only hope to do this for each shape function individually. in fact,
there are even weird finite elements (for example the
Raviart-Thomas element) which have shape functions that are
additive (interior ones) and others that are overwriting (face
degrees of freedom that need to be continuous across the face)."	2	2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

! @file
!  This file contains routines to extract & process command flags.  The
!  command flags recognized by PLplot are stored in the ""ploption_table""
!  structure, along with strings giving the syntax, long help message, and
!  option handler.
!
!  The command line parser -- plparseopts() -- removes all recognized flags
!  (decreasing argc accordingly), so that invalid input may be readily
!  detected.  It can also be used to process user command line flags.  The
!  user can merge an option table of type PLOptionTable into the internal
!  option table info structure using plMergeOpts().  Or, the user can
!  specify that ONLY the external table(s) be parsed by calling
!  plClearOpts() before plMergeOpts().
!
!  The default action taken by plparseopts() is as follows:
!      - Returns with an error if an unrecognized option or badly formed
!        option-value pair are encountered.
!      - Returns immediately (return code 0) when the first non-option
!        command line argument is found.
!      - Returns with the return code of the option handler, if one
!        was called.
!      - Deletes command line arguments from argv list as they are found,
!        and decrements argc accordingly.
!      - Does not show ""invisible"" options in usage or help messages.
!      - Assumes the program name is contained in argv[0].
!
!  These behaviors may be controlled through the ""mode"" argument, which can
!  have the following bits set:
!
!  PL_PARSE_FULL -- Full parsing of command line and all error messages
!  enabled, including program exit when an error occurs.  Anything on the
!  command line that isn't recognized as a valid option or option argument
!  is flagged as an error.
!
!  PL_PARSE_QUIET -- Turns off all output except in the case of
!  errors.
!
!  PL_PARSE_NODELETE -- Turns off deletion of processed arguments.
!
!  PL_PARSE_SHOWALL -- Show invisible options
!
!  PL_PARSE_NOPROGRAM -- Specified if argv[0] is NOT a pointer to the
!  program name.
!
!  PL_PARSE_NODASH -- Set if leading dash is NOT required.
!
!  PL_PARSE_SKIP -- Set to quietly skip over any unrecognized args.
!
!  Note: if you want to have both your option and a PLplot option of the
!  same name processed (e.g. the -v option in plrender), do the following:
!      1. Tag your option with PL_OPT_NODELETE
!      2. Give it an option handler that uses a return code of 1.
!      3. Merge your option table in.
!  By merging your table, your option will be processed before the PLplot
!  one.  The PL_OPT_NODELETE ensures that the option string is not deleted
!  from the argv list, and the return code of 1 ensures that the parser
!  continues looking for it.
!
!  See plrender.c for examples of actual usage.

 * FormAdd()

 * Stores a formpost parameter and builds the appropriate linked list.

 * Has two principal functionalities: using files and byte arrays as

 * (as the user requests) while for files only the filename and not the
 * content is stored.
 *
 * While you may have only one byte array for each name, multiple filenames
 * are allowed (and because of this feature CURLFORM_END is needed after
 * using CURLFORM_FILE).
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Simple name/value pair with copied contents:
 * curl_formadd (&post, &last, CURLFORM_COPYNAME, ""name"",
 * CURLFORM_COPYCONTENTS, ""value"", CURLFORM_END);
 *
 * name/value pair where only the content pointer is remembered:
 * curl_formadd (&post, &last, CURLFORM_COPYNAME, ""name"",
 * CURLFORM_PTRCONTENTS, ptr, CURLFORM_CONTENTSLENGTH, 10, CURLFORM_END);
 * (if CURLFORM_CONTENTSLENGTH is missing strlen () is used)
 *
 * storing a filename (CONTENTTYPE is optional!):
 * curl_formadd (&post, &last, CURLFORM_COPYNAME, ""name"",

 * storing multiple filenames:

as explained there, we do something only if there are exactly 2

then there is nothing to do anyway, and if there are 3 or more,
then we can get into trouble. note that this only happens for lines
in 3d and higher, and for quads only in 4d and higher, so this
isn't a particularly frequent case

there is one case, however, that we would like to handle (see, for
example, the hp/crash_15 testcase): if we have
FESystem(FE_Q(2),FE_DGQ(i)) elements for a bunch of values 'i',
then we should be able to handle this because we can simply unify
*all* dofs, not only a some. so what we do is to first treat all

 * write the result is the original PNG data that would have would have been
 * read if no transform were applied.
 *
 * The exception is _SHIFT, which destroys the low order bits marked as not
 * significant in a PNG with the sBIT chunk.
 *
 * The following table lists, for each transform, the conditions under which it
 * is expected to do anything.  Conditions are defined as follows:
 *
 * 1) Color mask bits required - simply a mask to AND with color_type; one of
 *    these must be present for the transform to fire, except that 0 means
 *    'always'.
 * 2) Color mask bits which must be absent - another mask - none of these must
 *    be present.
 * 3) Bit depths - a mask of component bit depths for the transform to fire.
 * 4) 'read' - the transform works in png_read_png.
 * 5) 'write' - the transform works in png_write_png.
 * 6) PNG_INFO_chunk; a mask of the chunks that must be present for the
 *    transform to fire.  All must be present - the requirement is that
 *    png_get_valid() & mask == mask, so if mask is 0 there is no requirement.
 *
 * The condition refers to the original image state - if multiple transforms are
 * used together it is possible to cause a transform that wouldn't fire on the
 * original image to fire."	2	2

Eeeksss... this wasn't a nice bit of code to work out, let me tell you.
I could not work out an entirely satisfactory solution that made
logical sense, so came up with an ""illogical"" one as well.
The logical one works fine for text in the normal ""portrait""
orientation, and does so for reasons you might expect it to work; But
for all other orientations, the text's base line is either a little
high, or a little low. This is because of the way the base-line pos
is calculated from the decender height. The ""dodgie"" way of calculating
the position is to use the character height here, then adjust for the
decender height by a three-fold factor later on. That approach seems to
work a little better for rotated pages, but why it should be so, I
don't understand. You can compile in or out which way you want it by
defining ""DODGIE_DECENDER_HACK"".

note: the logic of the page rotation coming up next is that we pump in
the justification factor and then use freetype to rotate and transform
the values, which we then use to change the plotting location.

decide whether or not we should render natively as unicode, and then
convert between hershey and unicode.

try to render it as a hershey font. Understandably, this might make
testing out the unicode functions a little tricky, so if you want

To help things, in fe_data, we have precomputed (sigma_{i} -
sigma_{j}) and (lambda_{i} + lambda_{j}) for 0<= i,j <
lines_per_cell.

There are two types:
- lower order (1 per edge, m):
\phi_{m}^{\mathcal{N}_{0}} = 1/2 grad(\sigma_{m})\lambda_{m}

- higher order (degree per edge, m):
\phi_{i}^{E_{m}} = grad( L_{i+2}(\sigma_{m}) (\lambda_{m}) ).

NOTE: In the ref cell, sigma_{m} is a function of x OR y OR Z
and lambda_{m} a function of the remaining co-ords.
for example, if sigma is of x, then lambda is of y AND
z, and so on. This means that grad(\sigma) requires
multiplication by d(sigma)/dx_{i} for the i^th comp of
grad(sigma) and similarly when taking derivatives of
lambda.

First handle the lowest order edges (dofs 0 to 11)

repos/libpng-code/contrib/libtests/pngstest.c	"Conversion between pixel formats.  The code above effectively eliminates the
 * component ordering changes leaving three basic changes:
 *
 * 1) Remove an alpha channel by pre-multiplication or compositing on a
 *    background color.  (Adding an alpha channel is a no-op.)
 *
 * 2) Remove color by mapping to grayscale.  (Grayscale to color is a no-op.)
 *
 * 3) Convert between 8-bit and 16-bit components.  (Both directtions are
 *    relevant.)
 *
 * This gives the following base format conversion matrix:

repos/dealii/source/fe/mapping_q_generic.cc	"we need to compare the position of the computed p(x) against the
given point 'p'. We will terminate the iteration and return 'x' if
they are less than eps apart. The question is how to choose eps --
or, put maybe more generally: in which norm we want these 'p' and
'p(x)' to be eps apart.

the question is difficult since we may have to deal with very
elongated cells where we may achieve 1e-12*h for the distance of
these two points in the 'long' direction, but achieving this
tolerance in the 'short' direction of the cell may not be possible

what we do instead is then to terminate iterations if
\| p(x) - p \|_A < eps
where the A-norm is somehow induced by the transformation of the
cell. in particular, we want to measure distances relative to the
sizes of the cell in its principal directions.

to define what exactly A should be, note that to first order we have
the following (assuming that x* is the solution of the problem, i.e.,
p(x*)=p):
p(x) - p = p(x) - p(x*)
= -grad p(x) * (x*-x) + higher order terms
This suggest to measure with a norm that corresponds to
A = {[grad p(x]^T [grad p(x)]}^{-1}
because then
\| p(x) - p \|_A  \approx  \| x - x* \|
Consequently, we will try to enforce that
\| p(x) - p \|_A  =  \| f \|  <=  eps

Note that using this norm is a bit dangerous since the norm changes
in every iteration (A isn't fixed by depends on xk). However, if the
cell is not too deformed (it may be stretched, but not twisted) then
the mapping is almost linear and A is indeed constant or nearly so."	2	2

!  These function perform variuos affine transformations.

! For background on these affine functions see SVG specification, e.g.,
! http://www.w3.org/TR/SVGTiny12/coords.html#EstablishingANewUserSpace.
! Affine 3x3 matrices with elements A_i,j always have a last row of
! 0, 0, 1 so the elements are conveniently stored in a vector in the order
! A_1_1, A_2_1, A_1_2, A_2_2, A_1_3, A_2_3, with the last row implied.
!
! N.B.  The PLplot affine interpretation of translate, scale, etc., is
! as actions on coordinate systems, rather than actions on objects.  This
! is identical to the SVG specficiation interpretation.  However, the
! SVG specification interprets the affine matrix as follows:
! old_coord_vector = affine_matrix * new_coordinate vector.  In PLplot
! we use the alternative interpretation
! new_coord_vector = affine_matrix * old_coordinate vector.
! The result is all affine matrices below are the inverses of the SVG
! equivalents.
!
! N.B. All PLplot affine functions below return the affine matrix result (in
! vector form) as the first argument).  It is the calling routine's
! responsibility to provide the space for all affine matrix arguments,
! i.e., a PLFLT array with a dimension of 6.

weight_mapping is used to map the global (fine grid) parameter dof
indices to the columns

in the original implementation, the weights array was actually of
FullMatrix<double> type. this wasted huge amounts of memory, but was
fast. nonetheless, since the memory consumption was quadratic in the
number of degrees of freedom, this was not very practical, so we now use
a vector of rows of the matrix, and in each row a vector of pairs
(colnum,value). this seems like the best tradeoff between memory and
speed, as it is now linear in memory and still fast enough.

to save some memory and since the weights are usually (negative) powers

As a side remark, one may wonder the following:
neighbor_child is clearly computed correctly,
i.e. taking into account face_orientation (just
look at the implementation of that function).
however, we don't care about this here, when we
ask for subface_interpolation on subface c. the
question rather is: do we have to translate 'c'
here as well?

the answer is in fact 'no'. if one does that,
results are wrong: constraints are added twice
for the same pair of nodes but with differing
weights. in addition, one can look at the
deal.II/project_*_03 tests that look at exactly
this case: there, we have a mesh with at least
one face_orientation==false and hanging nodes,

this function implements the following strategy based on the
p's dimension:

* In 1D this mapping is linear, so the mapping is always invertible
(and the exact formula is known) as long as the cell has non-zero
length.
* In 2D the exact (quadratic) formula is called first. If either the
exact formula does not succeed (negative discriminant in the
quadratic formula) or succeeds but finds a solution outside of the
unit cell, then the Newton solver is called. The rationale for the
second choice is that the exact formula may provide two different
answers when mapping a point outside of the real cell, but the
Newton solver (if it converges) will only return one answer.
Otherwise the exact formula successfully found a point in the unit
cell and that value is returned.

algorithm is used."	2	2

Support routines for freetype font engine

This file contains a series of support routines for drivers interested
in using freetype rendered fonts instead of plplot plotter fonts.
Freetype supports a gerth of font formats including TrueType, OpenType,
Adobe Type1, Type42 etc... the list seems almost endless. Any bitmap
driver should be able to use any of these freetype fonts from plplot if
these routines are properly initialised.

Freetype support is not intended to be a ""feature"" of the common API,
but is  implemented as a driver-specific optional extra invoked via the
-drvopt command line toggle. It is intended to be used in the context of
""PLESC_HAS_TEXT"" for any bitmap drivers without native font support.
Implementing freetype in this manner minimise changes to the overall
API. Because of this approach, there is not a ""wealth"" of font options
available to the programmer. You can not do anything you can't do for a
normal freetype plotter font like boldface. You can do most of the
things that you can do with a plotter font however, like greek
characters superscripting, and selecting one of the four ""pre-defined""
plplot font types. At present underlining and overlining are not
supported.

To give the user some level of control over the fonts that are used,
environmental variables can be set to over-ride the definitions used by
the five default plplot fonts.

The exact syntax for evoking freetype fonts is dependant on each
driver, but for the GD and GNUSVGA drivers I have followed the syntax of
the PS driver and use the command-line switch of ""-drvopt text"" to
activate the feature, and suggest other programmers do the same for
commonality.

Both anti-aliased and monochrome font rendering is supported by these
routines. How these are evoked depends on the programmer, but with the
GD and GNUSVGA driver families I have used the command-line switch
""-drvopt smooth"" to activate the feature; but, considering you also need
to turn freetype on, it would probably really be more like ""-drvopt
text,smooth"".

REAL_SCALARS    := { double; float}
COMPLEX_SCALARS := { std::complex<double>;
std::complex<float>}
VECTORS := { Vector<double>; Vector<float>}
--------------------

The input file is typically located in share/deal.II/template-arguments in
the build directory and it is built from cmake/config/template-arguments.in
to contain the list of vectors etc. that make sense for the current
configuration. For example, the list of VECTORS is going to contain PETSc
vectors if so configured.

The second input is read from the command line and consists of a sequence
of statements of the following form:
--------------------
for (u,v:VECTORS; z:SCALARS) { f(u, z, const v &); }
--------------------
Here, everything between {...} will be copied as many times as there are
combinations of arguments u,v in the list of substitutions given by
VECTORS. For each copy, the arguments u,v will be replaced by one of these
combinations."	2	2

void plenv()

Simple interface for defining viewport and window.

The ""just"" parameter control how the axes will be scaled:

just=-1 : The scales will not be set, the user must set up the scale
before calling plenv() using plsvpa(), plvasp() or other;
just= 0 : The scales will be set up to optimize plot area;
just= 1 : The scales will be the same;
just= 2 : The axes will be equal, the plot box will be square.

The ""axis"" parameter is interpreted as follows:

axis=-2 : draw no box, no tick marks, no numeric tick labels, no axes.
axis=-1 : draw box only.
axis= 0 : Draw box, ticks, and numeric tick labels.
axis= 1 : Also draw coordinate axes at X=0, and Y=0.

 *
 * Fixes a PNG file written with libpng-1.6.0 or 1.6.1 that has one or more
 * uncompressed iTXt chunks.  Assumes that the actual length is greater
 * than or equal to the value in the length byte, and that the CRC is

 * adjusts the length byte accordingly.  It is not an error to process a
 * PNG file that has no iTXt chunks or one that has valid iTXt chunks;
 * such files will simply be copied.
 *
 * Requires zlib (for crc32 and Z_NULL); build with
 *
 *     gcc -O -o png-fix-itxt png-fix-itxt.c -lz
 *
 * If you need to handle iTXt chunks larger than 500000 kbytes you must
 * rebuild png-fix-itxt with a larger values of MAX_LENGTH (or a smaller value

       * When restricting, on a face, the degrees of freedom of fe1 to the space
       * described by fe2 (for example for the complex case described
       * in the @ref hp_paper ""hp paper""), we have to select fe2.dofs_per_face
       * out of the fe1.dofs_per_face face DoFs as the
       * master DoFs, and the rest become slave dofs. This function selects
       * which ones will be masters, and which ones will be slaves.
       *
       * The function assumes that master_dofs already has size
       * fe1.dofs_per_face. After the function, exactly fe2.dofs_per_face
       * entries will be true.
       *
       * The function is a bit complicated since it has to figure out a set a
       * DoFs so that the corresponding rows in the face interpolation matrix
       * are all linearly independent. we have a good heuristic (see the
       * function body) for selecting these rows, but there are cases where this
       * fails and we have to pick them differently. what we do is to run the

repos/libpng-code/pngrutil.c	"For pixel depths up to 4 bpp the 8-pixel mask can be expanded to fit
          * into 32 bits, then a single loop over the bytes using the four byte
          * values in the 32-bit mask can be used.  For the 'display' option the
          * expanded mask may also not require any masking within a byte.  To
          * make this work the PACKSWAP option must be taken into account - it
          * simply requires the pixels to be reversed in each byte.
          *
          * The 'regular' case requires a mask for each of the first 6 passes,
          * the 'display' case does a copy for the even passes in the range
          * 0..6.  This has already been handled in the test above.
          *
          * The masks are arranged as four bytes with the first byte to use in
          * the lowest bits (little-endian) regardless of the order (PACKSWAP or
          * not) of the pixels in each byte.
          *
          * NOTE: the whole of this logic depends on the caller of this function
          * only calling it on rows appropriate to the pass.  This function only
          * understands the 'x' logic; the 'y' logic is handled by the caller.
          *
          * The following defines allow generation of compile time constant bit
          * masks for each pixel depth and each possibility of swapped or not
          * swapped bytes.  Pass 'p' is in the range 0..6; 'x', a pixel index,
          * is in the range 0..7; and the result is 1 if the pixel is to be
          * copied in the pass, 0 if not.  'S' is for the sparkle method, 'B'
          * for the block method.
          *
          * With some compilers a compile time expression of the general form:
          *
          *    (shift >= 32) ? (a >> (shift-32)) : (b >> shift)
          *
          * Produces warnings with values of 'shift' in the range 33 to 63
          * because the right hand side of the ?: expression is evaluated by
          * the compiler even though it isn't used.  Microsoft Visual C (various
          * versions) and the Intel C compiler are known to do this.  To avoid
          * this the following macros are used in 1.5.6.  This is a temporary

   wpng - simple PNG-writing program                                 wpng.c

   This program converts certain NetPBM binary files (grayscale and RGB,
   maxval = 255) to PNG.  Non-interlaced PNGs are written progressively;
   interlaced PNGs are read and written in one memory-intensive blast.

   Thanks to Jean-loup Gailly for providing the necessary trick to read
   interactive text from the keyboard while stdin is redirected.  Thanks
   to Cosmin Truta for Cygwin fixes.

   NOTE:  includes provisional support for PNM type ""8"" (portable alphamap)
          images, presumed to be a 32-bit interleaved RGBA format; no pro-
          vision for possible interleaved grayscale+alpha (16-bit) format.
          THIS IS UNLIKELY TO BECOME AN OFFICIAL NETPBM ALPHA FORMAT!

   to do:
    - delete output file if quit before calling any writepng routines
    - process backspace with -text option under DOS/Win? (currently get ^H)

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Changelog:
    - 1.01:  initial public release
    - 1.02:  modified to allow abbreviated options
    - 1.03:  removed extraneous character from usage screen; fixed bug in
              command-line parsing
    - 1.04:  fixed DOS/OS2/Win32 detection, including partial Cygwin fix
              (see http://home.att.net/~perlspinr/diffs/GregBook_cygwin.diff)
    - 2.00:  dual-licensed (added GNU GPL)
    - 2.01:  check for integer overflow (Glenn R-P)

        [REPORTED BUG (win32 only):  ""contrib/gregbook/wpng.c - cmd line
         dose not work!  In order to do something useful I needed to redirect
         both input and output, with cygwin and with bcc32 as well.  Under
         Linux, the same wpng appears to work fine.  I don't know what is
         the problem.""]

that finite element solutions from both sides coincide. i.e. if a and b
are expansion coefficients for the shape functions from both sides, we
seek a relation between a and b such that
sum_j a_j phi^c_j(x) == sum_j b_j phi_j(x)
for all points x on the interface. here, phi^c_j are the shape
functions on the small cell on one side of the face, and phi_j those on
the big cell on the other side. To get this relation, it suffices to
look at a sufficient number of points for which this has to hold. if
there are n functions, then we need n evaluation points, and we choose
them equidistantly.

we obtain the matrix system
A a  ==  B b
where
A_ij = phi^c_j(x_i)
B_ij = phi_j(x_i)
and the relation we are looking for is
a = A^-1 B b

for the special case of Lagrange interpolation polynomials, A_ij
reduces to delta_ij, and
a_i = B_ij b_j
Hence, interface_constraints(i,j)=B_ij.

for the general case, where we don't have Lagrange interpolation
polynomials, this is a little more complicated. Then we would evaluate
at a number of points and invert the interpolation matrix A.

Note, that we build up these matrices for all subfaces at once, rather
than considering them separately. the reason is that we finally will
want to have them in this order anyway, as this is the format we need

void plRotationShear

Calculates the rotation and shear angles from a plplot transformation matrix

N.B. the plot transformation matrix

[xFormMatrix[0] xFormMatrix[2]]
[xFormMatrix[1] xFormMatrix[3]]

is calculated as

[stride cos(t)    stride sin(t)]
[sin(p-t)              cos(p-t)]

where t is the rotation angle and p is the shear angle.
The purpose of this routine is to determine stride, rotation angle,
and shear angle from xFormMatrix.

For information only, xFormMatrix is the product of the following
rotation, skew(shear), and scale matrices:

[stride    0] [1      0] [cos(t)  sin(t)]
[0    cos(p)] [tan(p) 1] [-sin(t) cos(t)]

 * ----------------------------------
 *
 * This program is a single-threaded process.
 *
 * This program is intended to be highly portable and as such it must be kept
 * as simple as possible, due to this the only signal handling mechanisms used
 * will be those of ANSI C, and used only in the most basic form which is good
 * enough for the purpose of this program.
 *
 * For the above reason and the specific needs of this program signals SIGHUP,
 * SIGPIPE and SIGALRM will be simply ignored on systems where this can be
 * done.  If possible, signals SIGINT and SIGTERM will be handled by this
 * program as an indication to cleanup and finish execution as soon as
 * possible.  This will be achieved with a single signal handler
 * 'exit_signal_handler' for both signals.
 *
 * The 'exit_signal_handler' upon the first SIGINT or SIGTERM received signal
 * will just set to one the global var 'got_exit_signal' storing in global var
 * 'exit_signal' the signal that triggered this change.
 *
 * Nothing fancy that could introduce problems is used, the program at certain
 * points in its normal flow checks if var 'got_exit_signal' is set and in
 * case this is true it just makes its way out of loops and functions in
 * structured and well behaved manner to achieve proper program cleanup and
 * termination.
 *
 * Even with the above mechanism implemented it is worthwile to note that
 * other signals might still be received, or that there might be systems on
 * which it is not possible to trap and ignore some of the above signals.
 * This implies that for increased portability and reliability the program
 * must be coded as if no signal was being ignored or handled at all.  Enjoy
 * it!"	2	2

Set up a window for three-dimensional plotting. The data are mapped
into a box with world coordinate size ""basex"" by ""basey"" by ""height"",
with the base being symmetrically positioned about zero. Thus
the mapping between data 3-d and world 3-d coordinates is given by:

x = xmin   =>   wx = -0.5*basex
x = xmax   =>   wx =  0.5*basex
y = ymin   =>   wy = -0.5*basey
y = ymax   =>   wy =  0.5*basey
z = zmin   =>   wz =  0.0
z = zmax   =>   wz =  height

The world coordinate box is then viewed from position ""alt""-""az"",
measured in degrees. For proper operation, 0 <= alt <= 90 degrees,
but az can be any value.

Adjust for the descender - make sure the font is nice and centred

centre-lines, so that's why we have to do this. Since this is one of our
own adjustments, rather than a freetype one, we have to run it through
the transform matrix manually.

For some odd reason, this works best if we triple the
descender's height and then adjust the height later on...

plscmap1l()

! Set color map 1 colors using a piece-wise linear relationship between
! position in the color map (from 0 to 1) and position in HLS or RGB color
! space.  May be called at any time.
!
! The idea here is to specify a number of control points that specify the
! mapping between HLS (or RGB or CMY) and palette 1 value.  Between these
! points, linear interpolation is used.  By mapping position in the color
! map to function value, this gives a smooth variation of color with
! intensity.  Any number of control points may be specified, located at
! arbitrary positions (intensities), although typically 2 - 4 are enough.
! Another way of stating this is that we are traversing a given number of
! lines through HLS (or RGB) space as we move through cmap 1 entries.  The
! control points at the minimum and maximum intensity (0 and 1) must
! always be specified.  By adding more control points you can get more
! variation.  One good technique for plotting functions that vary about
! some expected average is to use an additional 2 control points in the
! center (intensity ~= 0.5) that are the same color as the background
! (typically white for paper output, black for crt), and same hue as the
! boundary control points.  This allows the highs and lows to be very
! easily distinguished.
!
! Each control point must specify the position in cmap 1 as well as three
! coordinates in HLS or RGB space.  The first and last points MUST correspond to
! cmap1 coordinates MIN_PLFLT_CMAP1 and MAX_PLFLT_CMAP1.
!
! Every change in hue from one control point to the next can be linearly
! interpolated in two ways.  The usual (alt_hue_path[i] false) method for the ith interval
! uses the dh = h[i+1] - h[i] interval for interpolation.  The alternate (alt_hue_path true) method for the ith interval uses the dh = (h[i+1] - h[i]) - 360 if (h[i+1] - h[i]) is positive or dh = 360 - (h[i+1] - h[i]) if (h[i+1] - h[i]) is negative interval for the interpolation.  Thus, alt_hue_path true interpolation intervals always include hue = 0.
! Specifying
! alt_hue_path=NULL is equivalent to setting alt_hue_path[]=false for every control point.
!
! Bounds on RGB coordinates:
!	R,G,B		[0, 1]		magnitude
!
! Bounds on HLS coordinates:
!	hue		[0, 360]	degrees
!	lightness	[0, 1]		magnitude
!	saturation	[0, 1]		magnitude
!
! The inputs are:
! @param itype 0: HLS, 1: RGB
! @param npts	number of control points
! @param intensity[] intensity index for each control point
! @param coord1[] first coordinate for each control point
! @param coord2[] second coordinate for each control point
! @param coord3[] third coordinate for each control point
! @param alt_hue_path[] if true, use alternative hue interpolation path

nx: dimension of the array in the X axis.
ny: dimension of the  array in the Y axis
The array data is indexed like data[ix][iy]

xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax:
data[0][0] corresponds to (xmin,ymin)
data[nx-1][ny-1] to (xmax,ymax)

zmin, zmax:
only data within bounds zmin <= data <= zmax will be
plotted. If zmin == zmax, all data will be ploted.

valuemin, valuemax:
The minimum and maximum values to use for value -> color
mappings.  A value in idata of valuemin or less will have
color 0.0 and a value in idata of valuemax or greater will
have color 1.0.  Values between valuemin and valuemax will
map linearly to to the colors between 0.0 and 1.0.
If you do not want to display values outside of the
(valuemin -> valuemax) range, then set zmin = valuemin and
zmax = valuemax.
This allows for multiple plots to use the same color scale

      Maple intends to do with it. This happens both with Maple4 and
      Maple5.

      Fortunately, Roger Young provided the following Fortran code, which
      is transcribed below to C. The code uses an algorithm that uses the
      invariants of a symmetric matrix. (The translated algorithm is
      augmented by a test for R>0, since R==0 indicates that all three

void plenv()

Simple interface for defining viewport and window.

The ""just"" parameter control how the axes will be scaled:

just=-1 : The scales will not be set, the user must set up the scale
before calling plenv() using plsvpa(), plvasp() or other;
just= 0 : The scales will be set up to optimize plot area;
just= 1 : The scales will be the same;
just= 2 : The axes will be equal, the plot box will be square.

The ""axis"" parameter is interpreted as follows:

axis=-2 : draw no box, no tick marks, no numeric tick labels, no axes.
axis=-1 : draw box only.
axis= 0 : Draw box, ticks, and numeric tick labels.
axis= 1 : Also draw coordinate axes at X=0, and Y=0.
axis= 2 : Also draw a grid at major tick positions in both coordinates.
axis= 3 : Same as 2, but the grid will be also at the minor ticks.

to be converted to logarithms separately.)
axis=11 : Same as 1 except Logarithmic X tick marks. (The X data have
to be converted to logarithms separately.)

to be converted to logarithms separately.)

int circulation()

Returns the circulation direction for a given polyline: positive is
counterclockwise, negative is clockwise (right hand rule).

Used to get the circulation of the fill polygon around the bounding box,
when the fill polygon is larger than the bounding box.  Counts left
(positive) vs right (negative) hand turns using a cross product, instead of
performing all the expensive trig calculations needed to get this 100%
correct.  For the fill cases encountered in plplot, this treatment should
give the correct answer most of the time, by far.  When used with plshades,
the typical return value is 3 or -3, since 3 turns are necessary in order
to complete the fill region.  Only for really oddly shaped fill regions
will it give the wrong answer.

AM:
Changed the computation: use the outer product to compute the surface
area, the sign determines if the polygon is followed clockwise or
counterclockwise. This is more reliable. Floating-point numbers
are used to avoid overflow.

repos/libpng-code/png.c	"The reverse calculation is more difficult because the original tristimulus
    * value had 9 independent values (red,green,blue)x(X,Y,Z) however only 8
    * derived values were recorded in the cHRM chunk;
    * (red,green,blue,white)x(x,y).  This loses one degree of freedom and
    * therefore an arbitrary ninth value has to be introduced to undo the
    * original transformations.
    *
    * Think of the original end-points as points in (X,Y,Z) space.  The
    * chromaticity values (c) have the property:
    *
    *           C
    *   c = ---------
    *       X + Y + Z
    *
    * For each c (x,y,z) from the corresponding original C (X,Y,Z).  Thus the
    * three chromaticity values (x,y,z) for each end-point obey the
    * relationship:
    *
    *   x + y + z = 1
    *
    * This describes the plane in (X,Y,Z) space that intersects each axis at the
    * value 1.0; call this the chromaticity plane.  Thus the chromaticity
    * calculation has scaled each end-point so that it is on the x+y+z=1 plane
    * and chromaticity is the intersection of the vector from the origin to the
    * (X,Y,Z) value with the chromaticity plane.
    *
    * To fully invert the chromaticity calculation we would need the three
    * end-point scale factors, (red-scale, green-scale, blue-scale), but these
    * were not recorded.  Instead we calculated the reference white (X,Y,Z) and
    * recorded the chromaticity of this.  The reference white (X,Y,Z) would have
    * given all three of the scale factors since:
    *
    *    color-C = color-c * color-scale
    *    white-C = red-C + green-C + blue-C
    *            = red-c*red-scale + green-c*green-scale + blue-c*blue-scale
    *
    * But cHRM records only white-x and white-y, so we have lost the white scale
    * factor:
    *
    *    white-C = white-c*white-scale
    *
    * To handle this the inverse transformation makes an arbitrary assumption
    * about white-scale:
    *
    *    Assume: white-Y = 1.0
    *    Hence:  white-scale = 1/white-y
    *    Or:     red-Y + green-Y + blue-Y = 1.0
    *
    * Notice the last statement of the assumption gives an equation in three of
    * the nine values we want to calculate.  8 more equations come from the
    * above routine as summarised at the top above (the chromaticity
    * calculation):
    *
    *    Given: color-x = color-X / (color-X + color-Y + color-Z)
    *    Hence: (color-x - 1)*color-X + color.x*color-Y + color.x*color-Z = 0
    *
    * This is 9 simultaneous equations in the 9 variables ""color-C"" and can be
    * solved by Cramer's rule.  Cramer's rule requires calculating 10 9x9 matrix
    * determinants, however this is not as bad as it seems because only 28 of
    * the total of 90 terms in the various matrices are non-zero.  Nevertheless
    * Cramer's rule is notoriously numerically unstable because the determinant
    * calculation involves the difference of large, but similar, numbers.  It is
    * difficult to be sure that the calculation is stable for real world values
    * and it is certain that it becomes unstable where the end points are close
    * together.
    *
    * So this code uses the perhaps slightly less optimal but more
    * understandable and totally obvious approach of calculating color-scale.
    *
    * This algorithm depends on the precision in white-scale and that is
    * (1/white-y), so we can immediately see that as white-y approaches 0 the
    * accuracy inherent in the cHRM chunk drops off substantially.
    *
    * libpng arithmetic: a simple inversion of the above equations
    * ------------------------------------------------------------
    *
    *    white_scale = 1/white-y
    *    white-X = white-x * white-scale
    *    white-Y = 1.0
    *    white-Z = (1 - white-x - white-y) * white_scale
    *
    *    white-C = red-C + green-C + blue-C
    *            = red-c*red-scale + green-c*green-scale + blue-c*blue-scale
    *
    * This gives us three equations in (red-scale,green-scale,blue-scale) where
    * all the coefficients are now known:
    *
    *    red-x*red-scale + green-x*green-scale + blue-x*blue-scale
    *       = white-x/white-y
    *    red-y*red-scale + green-y*green-scale + blue-y*blue-scale = 1
    *    red-z*red-scale + green-z*green-scale + blue-z*blue-scale
    *       = (1 - white-x - white-y)/white-y
    *
    * In the last equation color-z is (1 - color-x - color-y) so we can add all
    * three equations together to get an alternative third:
    *
    *    red-scale + green-scale + blue-scale = 1/white-y = white-scale
    *
    * So now we have a Cramer's rule solution where the determinants are just
    * 3x3 - far more tractible.  Unfortunately 3x3 determinants still involve
    * multiplication of three coefficients so we can't guarantee to avoid
    * overflow in the libpng fixed point representation.  Using Cramer's rule in
    * floating point is probably a good choice here, but it's not an option for
    * fixed point.  Instead proceed to simplify the first two equations by
    * eliminating what is likely to be the largest value, blue-scale:
    *
    *    blue-scale = white-scale - red-scale - green-scale
    *
    * Hence:
    *
    *    (red-x - blue-x)*red-scale + (green-x - blue-x)*green-scale =
    *                (white-x - blue-x)*white-scale
    *
    *    (red-y - blue-y)*red-scale + (green-y - blue-y)*green-scale =
    *                1 - blue-y*white-scale
    *
    * And now we can trivially solve for (red-scale,green-scale):
    *
    *    green-scale =
    *                (white-x - blue-x)*white-scale - (red-x - blue-x)*red-scale
    *                -----------------------------------------------------------
    *                                  green-x - blue-x
    *
    *    red-scale =
    *                1 - blue-y*white-scale - (green-y - blue-y) * green-scale
    *                ---------------------------------------------------------
    *                                  red-y - blue-y
    *
    * Hence:
    *
    *    red-scale =
    *          ( (green-x - blue-x) * (white-y - blue-y) -
    *            (green-y - blue-y) * (white-x - blue-x) ) / white-y
    * -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    *  (green-x - blue-x)*(red-y - blue-y)-(green-y - blue-y)*(red-x - blue-x)
    *
    *    green-scale =
    *          ( (red-y - blue-y) * (white-x - blue-x) -
    *            (red-x - blue-x) * (white-y - blue-y) ) / white-y
    * -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    *  (green-x - blue-x)*(red-y - blue-y)-(green-y - blue-y)*(red-x - blue-x)
    *
    * Accuracy:
    * The input values have 5 decimal digits of accuracy.  The values are all in
    * the range 0 < value < 1, so simple products are in the same range but may
    * need up to 10 decimal digits to preserve the original precision and avoid
    * underflow.  Because we are using a 32-bit signed representation we cannot
    * match this; the best is a little over 9 decimal digits, less than 10.
    *
    * The approach used here is to preserve the maximum precision within the
    * signed representation.  Because the red-scale calculation above uses the
    * difference between two products of values that must be in the range -1..+1
    * it is sufficient to divide the product by 7; ceil(100,000/32767*2).  The
    * factor is irrelevant in the calculation because it is applied to both
    * numerator and denominator.
    *
    * Note that the values of the differences of the products of the
    * chromaticities in the above equations tend to be small, for example for
    * the sRGB chromaticities they are:
    *
    * red numerator:    -0.04751
    * green numerator:  -0.08788
    * denominator:      -0.2241 (without white-y multiplication)
    *
    *  The resultant Y coefficients from the chromaticities of some widely used
    *  color space definitions are (to 15 decimal places):
    *
    *  sRGB
    *    0.212639005871510 0.715168678767756 0.072192315360734

 *
 * o We want the perl code to work with rather old perl installations, thus
 *   we cannot use recent perl modules or features.
 *
 * o We want IPv6 support for systems that provide it, and doing optional IPv6
 *   support in perl seems if not impossible so at least awkward.
 *
 * o We want FTP-SSL support, which means that a connection that starts with
 *   plain sockets needs to be able to ""go SSL"" in the midst. This would also

This is the 3d equivalent of plmtex(). It prints out ""text"" at specified
position relative to viewport (may be inside or outside)

side	String contains one or more of the following characters
x,y,z : Specify which axis is to be labeled
p,s   : Label the ""primary"" or the ""secondary"" axis. The ""primary"" axis
being somewhat arbitrary, but basically it is the one that you'd
expect to labeled in a 3d graph of standard orientation. Example:
for z this would be the left hand axis.
v     : draw the text perpendicular to the axis.

disp Displacement from specified edge of axis, measured outwards from
the axis in units of the current character height. The
centerlines of the characters are aligned with the specified
position.

pos	Position of the reference point of the string relative to the
axis ends, ranging from 0.0 (left-hand end) to 1.0 (right-hand
end)

just	Justification of string relative to reference point
just = 0.0 => left hand edge of string is at reference
just = 1.0 => right hand edge of string is at reference
just = 0.5 => center of string is at reference

! For background on these affine functions see SVG specification, e.g.,
! http://www.w3.org/TR/SVGTiny12/coords.html#EstablishingANewUserSpace.
! Affine 3x3 matrices with elements A_i,j always have a last row of
! 0, 0, 1 so the elements are conveniently stored in a vector in the order
! A_1_1, A_2_1, A_1_2, A_2_2, A_1_3, A_2_3, with the last row implied.
!
! N.B.  The PLplot affine interpretation of translate, scale, etc., is
! as actions on coordinate systems, rather than actions on objects.  This
! is identical to the SVG specficiation interpretation.  However, the
! SVG specification interprets the affine matrix as follows:
! old_coord_vector = affine_matrix * new_coordinate vector.  In PLplot
! we use the alternative interpretation
! new_coord_vector = affine_matrix * old_coordinate vector.
! The result is all affine matrices below are the inverses of the SVG
! equivalents.
!
! N.B. All PLplot affine functions below return the affine matrix result (in
! vector form) as the first argument).  It is the calling routine's
! responsibility to provide the space for all affine matrix arguments,
! i.e., a PLFLT array with a dimension of 6.

allocate as many rows as there are parameter dofs on the coarse grid and
as many columns as there are parameter dofs on the fine grid.

weight_mapping is used to map the global (fine grid) parameter dof
indices to the columns

in the original implementation, the weights array was actually of
FullMatrix<double> type. this wasted huge amounts of memory, but was
fast. nonetheless, since the memory consumption was quadratic in the
number of degrees of freedom, this was not very practical, so we now use
a vector of rows of the matrix, and in each row a vector of pairs
(colnum,value). this seems like the best tradeoff between memory and
speed, as it is now linear in memory and still fast enough.

to save some memory and since the weights are usually (negative) powers
of 2, we choose the value type of the matrix to be @p{float} rather than

repos/libpng-code/contrib/libtests/pngvalid.c	"There are two basic forms of standard images.  Those which attempt to have
 * all the possible pixel values (not possible for 16bpp images, but a range of
 * values are produced) and those which have a range of image sizes.  The former
 * are used for testing transforms, in particular gamma correction and bit
 * reduction and increase.  The latter are reserved for testing the behavior of
 * libpng with respect to 'odd' image sizes - particularly small images where
 * rows become 1 byte and interlace passes disappear.
 *
 * The first, most useful, set are the 'transform' images, the second set of
 * small images are the 'size' images.
 *
 * The transform files are constructed with rows which fit into a 1024 byte row
 * buffer.  This makes allocation easier below.  Further regardless of the file
 * format every row has 128 pixels (giving 1024 bytes for 64bpp formats).
 *
 * Files are stored with no gAMA or sBIT chunks, with a PLTE only when needed
 * and with an ID derived from the colour type, bit depth and interlace type
 * as above (FILEID).  The width (128) and height (variable) are not stored in
 * the FILEID - instead the fields are set to 0, indicating a transform file.
 *
 * The size files ar constructed with rows a maximum of 128 bytes wide, allowing
 * a maximum width of 16 pixels (for the 64bpp case.)  They also have a maximum
 * height of 16 rows.  The width and height are stored in the FILEID and, being
 * non-zero, indicate a size file.
 *
 * Because the PNG filter code is typically the largest CPU consumer within
 * libpng itself there is a tendency to attempt to optimize it.  This results in
 * special case code which needs to be validated.  To cause this to happen the
 * 'size' images are made to use each possible filter, in so far as this is
 * possible for smaller images.
 *
 * For palette image (colour type 3) multiple transform images are stored with
 * the same bit depth to allow testing of more colour combinations -
 * particularly important for testing the gamma code because libpng uses a
 * different code path for palette images.  For size images a single palette is
 * used."	2	2

traverse the boundary in index order, the inside area of the
polygon is always on the left.  Finally, the first vertex of
polygon 1 (starting with n1 -1) that is not near the border of
polygon 2 must be outside polygon 2.  N.B. it is the calling
routine's responsibility to insure all those requirements are
satisfied.

Two polygons that do not self intersect must have an even number of
edge crossings between them.  (ignoring vertex intersections which
touch, but do not cross).  fill_intersection_polygon eliminates
those intersection crossings by recursion (calling the same routine
twice again with the second polygon split at a boundary defined by
the first intersection point, all polygon 1 vertices between the
intersections, and the second intersection point).  Once the
recursion has eliminated all crossing edges, fill or not using the
appropriate polygon depending on whether the first and second
polygons are identical or whether one of them is entirely inside
the other of them.  If ifextrapolygon is true, the fill step will
consist of another recursive call to the routine with
ifextrapolygon false, and the second polygon set to an additional
polygon defined by the stream (not yet implemented)."	2	2

void plpoly3( n, x, y, z, draw, ifcc )

Draws a polygon in 3 space.  This differs from plline3() in that
this attempts to determine if the polygon is viewable.  If the back
of polygon is facing the viewer, then it isn't drawn.  If this
isn't what you want, then use plline3 instead.

n specifies the number of points.  They are assumed to be in a
plane, and the directionality of the plane is determined from the
first three points.  Additional points do not /have/ to lie on the
plane defined by the first three, but if they do not, then the
determiniation of visibility obviously can't be 100% accurate...
So if you're 3 space polygons are too far from planar, consider
breaking them into smaller polygons.  ""3 points define a plane"" :-).

For ifcc == 1, the directionality of the polygon is determined by assuming
the points are laid out in counter-clockwise order.

For ifcc == 0, the directionality of the polygon is determined by assuming
the points are laid out in clockwise order.

BUGS:  If one of the first two segments is of zero length, or if
they are colinear, the calculation of visibility has a 50/50 chance
of being correct.  Avoid such situations :-).  See x18c for an
example of this problem.  (Search for ""20.1"").

as mentioned in the paper, it is not always easy to find a set of
master dofs that produces an invertible matrix. to this end, we check
in each step whether the matrix is still invertible and simply
discard this dof if the matrix is not invertible anymore.

the cases where we did have trouble in the past were with adding more
quad dofs when Q3 and Q4 elements meet at a refined face in 3d (see
the hp/crash_12 test that tests that we can do exactly this, and
failed before we had code to compensate for this case). the other
case are system elements: if we have say a Q1Q2 vs a Q2Q3 element,
then we can't just take all master dofs on a line from a single base
element, since the shape functions of that base element are
independent of that of the other one. this latter case shows up when

To help things, in fe_data, we have precomputed (sigma_{i} -
sigma_{j}) and (lambda_{i} + lambda_{j}) for 0<= i,j <
lines_per_cell.

There are two types:
- lower order (1 per edge, m):
\phi_{m}^{\mathcal{N}_{0}} = 1/2 grad(\sigma_{m})\lambda_{m}

- higher order (degree per edge, m):
\phi_{i}^{E_{m}} = grad( L_{i+2}(\sigma_{m}) (\lambda_{m}) ).

NOTE: sigma_{m} and lambda_{m} are either a function of x OR
y
and if sigma is of x, then lambda is of y, and vice
versa. This means that grad(\sigma) requires
multiplication by d(sigma)/dx_{i} for the i^th comp of
grad(sigma) and similarly when taking derivatives of
lambda.

lambda is function of x). 2 and 3 are the edges in the x dir.

as explained there, we do something only if there are exactly 2
finite elements associated with an object. if there is only one,
then there is nothing to do anyway, and if there are 3 or more,
then we can get into trouble. note that this only happens for lines
in 3d and higher, and for quads only in 4d and higher, so this
isn't a particularly frequent case

there is one case, however, that we would like to handle (see, for
example, the hp/crash_15 testcase): if we have
FESystem(FE_Q(2),FE_DGQ(i)) elements for a bunch of values 'i',

 *
 * Poynton's current link (as of January 2003 through July 2011):
 * <http://www.poynton.com/notes/colour_and_gamma/>
 * has changed the numbers slightly:
 *
 *     Y = 0.2126*R + 0.7152*G + 0.0722*B
 *
 *  which can be expressed with integers as
 *
 *     Y = (6966 * R + 23436 * G + 2366 * B)/32768
 *
 *  Historically, however, libpng uses numbers derived from the ITU-R Rec 709
 *  end point chromaticities and the D65 white point.  Depending on the
 *  precision used for the D65 white point this produces a variety of different
 *  numbers, however if the four decimal place value used in ITU-R Rec 709 is
 *  used (0.3127,0.3290) the Y calculation would be:
 *
 *     Y = (6968 * R + 23435 * G + 2366 * B)/32768
 *
 *  While this is correct the rounding results in an overflow for white, because
 *  the sum of the rounded coefficients is 32769, not 32768.  Consequently
 *  libpng uses, instead, the closest non-overflowing approximation:
 *
 *     Y = (6968 * R + 23434 * G + 2366 * B)/32768
 *
 *  Starting with libpng-1.5.5, if the image being converted has a cHRM chunk
 *  (including an sRGB chunk) then the chromaticities are used to calculate the
 *  coefficients.  See the chunk handling in pngrutil.c for more information.
 *
 *  In all cases the calculation is to be done in a linear colorspace.  If no
 *  gamma information is available to correct the encoding of the original RGB
 *  values this results in an implicit assumption that the original PNG RGB
 *  values were linear.
 *
 *  Other integer coefficients can be used via png_set_rgb_to_gray().  Because
 *  the API takes just red and green coefficients the blue coefficient is
 *  calculated to make the sum 32768.  This will result in different rounding
