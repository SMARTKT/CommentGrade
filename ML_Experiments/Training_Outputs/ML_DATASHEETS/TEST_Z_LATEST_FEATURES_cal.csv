"NOTE: if you want this code to work on Windows with libcurl as a DLL, you
     MUST also provide a read callback with CURLOPT_READFUNCTION. Failing to
     do so will give you a crash since a DLL may not use the variable's memory
     when passed in to it from an app like this."	curl/tests/libtest/lib525.c/lib525.c
"Set the size of the file to upload (optional).  If you give a *_LARGE
     option you MUST make sure that the type of the passed-in argument is a
     curl_off_t. If you use CURLOPT_INFILESIZE (without _LARGE) you must
     make sure that to pass in a type 'long' argument."	curl/tests/libtest/lib525.c/lib525.c
